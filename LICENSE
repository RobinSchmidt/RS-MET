This is repository contains code from various sources and different parts are 
subject to different licensing schemes. 

For my own code, primarily the DSP libraries rapt and rosic, my plugin 
framework jura_framework and my actual plugin code in jura_processors, I go
with a dual licensing scheme similar to juce's: you can use the code under 
the terms of GPL or some compatibe open source license* or you can arrange for
a closed source license with me, for which I typically charge a per-product 
licensing fee, the terms of which I negotiate individually on a case by case 
basis.

If you want to use the juce-based parts of the library and/or want to make
VST plugins, you will need to adhere to the licensing terms of Roli and 
Steinberg, too:

(*) I don't really care about the specifics of GPL and I actually find it a bit
too restrictive. What I do care about is fairness and advancing and supporting 
open source culture.
