Should I pass away, I hereby declare that all parts of this repository whose author I am shall 
become public domain. This entails in particular, but not only, the contents of the folder:

Libraries\RobsJuceModules

The same goes, by the way, for all my other repositories as well. It is my last will that my code 
will be of value for something and cool things will be built from it. Live long and prosper!
