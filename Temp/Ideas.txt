SmoothedValue:
-see class juce::LinearSmoothedValue
-generalize to an update equation: x[n+1] = a*x[n] + b
-allows for linear and exponential smoothing and anything between
-general term is: 
 x[n] = a^n * x[0] + b * sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^n 
      = a^n * x0   + b * n * a^n 
	  = a^n * (x0 + b)
-maybe we can have a kind of "exponentiality" parameter p between 0..1
 with 0, we have linear scaling (a = 1), with 1 exponential (b = 0)
 maybe a = 1-p, b = p * c (for some suitable c)

CommandQueue:
-lockfree queue of commands
-uses circular buffer (maybe juce::AbstractFifo)
-used for sending commands from a main/gui thread to audio thread
-main thread enqueues new commands
-has a 2nd queue with dynamic memory allocation to let the producer thread
 (main thread) store commands that currently don't fit in the buffer
-audio thread's 1sta action inside the callback is to consume commands
-a consumed command sets an atomic int field in the command with a status 
 (initially 0: pending, 1: completed, 2: failed, higher values used for error 
 codes which can be displayed later in the gui thread)
-gui thread may delete completed commands ..or may keep them in a history
 for undo, replay, etc.
-fields for "Command":
 uint32: identifier, std::atomic<uint32> status, void* data
