-drag over the breakpoint modulator
-drag over the remaining GUI widget classes


-maybe split jura_framework module into jura_basics and jura_gui







make JUCE leaner:

The binaries for the JUCE based products are really big. Maybe we can reduce the bloat in the 
following way:
-in Libraries/JUCE create a 2nd subfolder modules_lean (or modules_stripped or whatever)
-copy over the folder contents of the original modules folder
-in each module folder, delete the guts and edit the master module header file to refer
 the includes to the original mdoule folder (this might potentially be a problem since
 the guts are not inside the module folder itself - if it turns out to be a problem,
 don't delete them and don't change the references)
-now that we have our own copy of the module folder, we can in each module include 
 h/cpp file pair comment out everything we don't need, thus we have a finer granularity of control
 over what gets compiled into the binary compared to leaving out completet modules (which may
 be not possible when we need a subset of some module)
-in the Projucer projects, set up the module path accordingly to use the modules 
 from the modules_lean folder
-this should reduce reduce the binary size and compilation time
