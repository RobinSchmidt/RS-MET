Manual Installation:

Windows:
-copy "ToolChain_VST2_x64.dll" into your 64-bit VST plugin folder, for example:
 C:\Program Files\VstPlugins
-copy the "RS-MET" folder into:
 C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming 
-The VST3 installation folder on windows is (a subfolder of):
   C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
 see: 
   https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/en-us/articles/115000177084-VST-plug-in-locations-on-Windows
 

Mac OSX:
-copy "ToolChain.component" into:
 Users/[UserName]/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
-copy "RS-MET" folder into:
 Users/[UserName]/Library
-If you can't find these folders in "Finder" (they are hidden), click on your main harddisk, choose 
 "Go" from the menu and enter the path directly. Or  better: Use Shift + Cmd + . to make hidden 
 files visible. But this doesn't work with all Windows keyboards - one of mine initiates the same 
 action as Shift + Alt + . when using the "Windows" button for Cmd. It behaves as if the Windows 
 button is just an alias for Alt (WTF!!!)

Notes:
On windows, there's also the C:\ProgramData folder. It seems to be the place where  programs store 
their own support files that are not supposed to be edited by the user, right? This could be used
for factory presets (SurgeXT does that) ...but mayb it's simpler, if we just stick to the scheme of
putting eveything into the AppData/Roaming/RS-MET folder
