/** This is the baseclass used for the test plugins. It simplifies the interface of the original   
VST baseclass. When you derive your plugin from this class instead of the original AudioEffectX
from the VST-SDK, you no longer have to override processReplacing, processDoubleReplacing - 
instead, you have to override processStereoFrame which is supposed to produce one stereo output
sampl-frae at a time (and is called here in our processReplacing override in a loop). This 
simplifies your implementation (but makes it also potenetially less efficient, but we don't care
about optimization here). Also, you don't need to ovveride setParameter anymore, instead 
override updateCoreParameter, which is called here in our overriden setParameter. This baseclass
keeps track of the normalized parameter in the array params - but you will want to keep track of
the corresponding unnormalized, mapped parameter in your subclass. */

/** This class is supposed to be used as baseclass for VST instruments, i.e. VST plugins that
handle MIDI inputs. It simplifies the original VST-SDK baseclass interface by not requiring you
to override processEvents anymore - a function that is supposed to collect an array of time-stamped
events which are supposed to be used subsequently in the process call. Instead, this baseclass here
collects the events and let's you handle one event at a time by overriding handleEvent or 
alternatively overriding onNoteOn/onControlChange/onPitchWheel. Overriding the latter 3 is less 
flexible but more convenient and often just what you need. Just override the event handlers and
processStereoFrame (inherited from vstPlugIn), and this baseclass takes over responsibility for 
sample accurate event handling. */
