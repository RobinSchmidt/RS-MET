For an easy workflow for debugging, build the PluginHost (in the 
AudioApplications folder) and set up the visual studio project such that it
runs the just built Plugin Host. For this to work, set on the Property settings
under "Debugging" the "Command" field to the .exe that results from the build.
On my machine, the path is:

E:\Programming\C++\RS-MET\Products\AudioApplications\PluginHost\Builds\VisualStudio2015\x64\Debug\Plugin Host.exe


to build a release version with the linux makefile, open a terminal in the 
folder containing the makefile and call:

make CONFIG=Release

just calling:

make

will build a debug version

the following developer packages have to be installed (via the command 
line terminal):
sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev 
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev 
sudo apt-get install libxinerama-dev
sudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev
sudo apt-get install libxcurl-dev
