Bugs:

- Here, someone says, that the sequencer in AcidDevil always runs at 140 bpm

   - This is not surprising because ToolChain itself currently has no mechanism in place to 
     retrieve the time-info from the host and pass it on to its sub-modules in the slots. 
   - Solution: Implement such a mechanism. Maybe by adding a virtual method setMidiTimeInfo to
     jura::AudioModule and in ToolChain::processBlock, retrieve the time-info from the host and
     loop over the slots to call that method to set it up. A refinement/optimization could be to do
     that only when at least one of the slots has a module that actually needs the time info (not 
     all do). That would require to keep track of that in the add/remove/replaceModule functions, 
     so it would be more code with more potential errors for later maintenance, so there's a 
     trade-off to be made: either always do that additinal loop thorugh all modules per block which 
     often may be unnecessary or tolerate some additional complication.

   that shouldn't
