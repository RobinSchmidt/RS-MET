Sampler
-load NoiseWhistel.sfz, then in teh TreeView:
 -click on cutoff -> cutoff slider appears
 -click on resonance -> reso slide does not appear
 -click volume -> slider appears
 -click resonance -> now the silder appears correctly
-Saving the sfz file seems to save the old (buffered) text unless the new code was parsed. Not sure
 if that behavior is good or bad...but probably bad
-When a new sfz file is added to the directory, the file-manager doesn't seem to recognize it - when 
 using the foward/backward skip buttons, it still only knows the old files. We probably need to 
 update the intenrally stored file-list after saving
