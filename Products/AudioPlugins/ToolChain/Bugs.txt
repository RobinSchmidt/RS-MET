General:
-after loading a patch with AcidDevil, the "Preset" label of AcidDevil is drawn in black. When 
 switching to another slot and back, this gets fixed
 check the painting of the stateWidgetSet member in jura::EditorWithStateFile
-[fixed?] load Acid8.xml in ToolChain, switch to next preset -> crash
 -it seems to have to do with the StereoDelay in Slot 2 (?)


Sampler
-[FIXED] load NoiseWhistle.sfz, then in the TreeView:
 -click on cutoff -> cutoff slider appears
 -click on resonance -> reso slide does not appear
 -click volume -> slider appears
 -click resonance -> now the silder appears correctly
 
-load NoiseWhistle.sfz, then in the TreeView:
 -click on cutoff 
 -change value
  -> debug assertion is triggered. Maybe it's because it's a group setting rather thana region 
  setting?

EchoLab:
-Produces memory leak when clsing the app

-Saving the sfz file seems to save the old (buffered) text unless the new code was parsed. Not sure
 if that behavior is good or bad...but probably bad
-When a new sfz file is added to the directory, the file-manager doesn't seem to recognize it - when 
 using the foward/backward skip buttons, it still only knows the old files. We probably need to 
 update the intenrally stored file-list after saving
