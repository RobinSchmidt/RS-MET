Preperations:

All platforms:
Get the RS-MET support files folder from here: https://github.com/RobinSchmidt/RS-MET-Data
and rename it to just RS-MET, i.e. remove the -Data. This folder has presets, samples, etc.


Windows:

-For VST 2, build the ToolChain_VST version of ToolChain in "Release" mode for "x64". To do that, 
 right-click on ToolChain_VST in the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio and choose 
 "Set as StartUp project" and then hit the "Play" button. 
-It will produce a file Release/VST/ToolChain.dll
-Rename the produced .dll to ToolChain_VST2_x64.dll (Why do we need this? To distinguish it from 
 other variants that may end up in the same installation folder later? I think so.)

-For Standalone, build the ToolChain_StandalonePlugin version in a similar way. 
-The produced Release/Standalone Plugin/ToolChain.exe should run from any folder.


Mac OSX:

Manual Installation:

Windows:
-Copy "ToolChain_VST2_x64.dll" into your 64-bit VST plugin folder, for example:
 C:\Program Files\VstPlugins
-Copy the "RS-MET" folder into:
 C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming 
-The VST3 installation folder on windows is (a subfolder of):
   C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
 see: 
   https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/en-us/articles/115000177084-VST-plug-in-locations-on-Windows
 

Mac OSX:
-Copy "ToolChain.component" into:
 Users/[UserName]/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
-Copy "RS-MET" folder into:
 Users/[UserName]/Library
-If you can't find these folders in "Finder" (they are hidden), click on your main harddisk, choose 
 "Go" from the menu and enter the path directly. Or  better: Use Shift + Cmd + . to make hidden 
 files visible. But this doesn't work with all Windows keyboards - one of mine initiates the same 
 action as Shift + Alt + . when using the "Windows" button for Cmd. It behaves as if the Windows 
 button is just an alias for Alt (WTF!!!)

Notes:

On windows, there's also the C:\ProgramData folder. It seems to be the place where  programs store 
their own support files that are not supposed to be edited by the user, right? This could be used
for factory presets (SurgeXT does that) ...but maybe it's simpler, if we just stick to the scheme of
putting everything into the AppData/Roaming/RS-MET folder
