For an easy workflow for debugging, build the PluginHost (in the 
AudioApplications folder) and set up the visual studio project such that it
runs the just built Plugin Host). For this to work, set on the Property settings
und er "Debugging" the "Command" field to the .exe that results from the build.
On my machine, the path is:

E:\Programming\C++\RS-MET-Preliminary\Products\AudioApplications\PluginHost\Builds\VisualStudio2015\x64\Debug\Plugin Host.exe
