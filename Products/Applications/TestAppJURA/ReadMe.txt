This project is a test application that does various tests of the jura framework and the stuff that
is used in ToolChain. At the moment, it contains mostly unit tests that can be invoked from the GUI
but it is meant to eventually also include performance test and interactive tests, i.e. test where 
the use can interact with the software from the GUI to test, say, some drawing facilities etc.
