Variuos tools for development, such as the Projucer

...later maybe include the binary builder, the old XMLBatchProcessor, AudioFileBatchConverter, 
RSPlot, etc. Maybe, we can make a GUI version of the binary builder, a text reformatting tool 
and basic file-browser would be nice (mainly to finally have a usable alternative to the 
obnoxious Finder on OSX) ...maybe all of this can be integrated into a single multifunctional
app. Maybe "RAPTDevel" or something. ...maybe it can even include the functionality of the 
Projucer - maybe we can use that as starting point? 
desired functionality:
-project management
-git stuff (basically, a GUI for GIT)
-run unit tests
-run performance test (and make nice plots)
-format code
-build binary resources
-function plotting (for exploration of math stuff)
-maybe it can even interface with symbolic computation engines such as SymbolicC++, GiNaC, ViennaMath?
-explore and play with the DSP algorithms, including analysis functions, plots, etc.
-rapid prototyping (angelscript), maybe with C++ code generation
-FIR and IIR filter design and C and/or C++ code generation (maybe using 
 arbitrary precision internally - look at the CLN library for multiprecison 
 math)
