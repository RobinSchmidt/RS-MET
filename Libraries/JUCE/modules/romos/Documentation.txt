class responsibilities:

Module:




AudioConnection:

-for each input pin in the target object, there is a pointer stored, which refers to the memory 
 location of the output pin of the source module
 -each input pin of a target can connect to only one output pin of a source
 -to gather inputs, an explicit adder module is needed - this is for efficiency




Event:

concrete modules:
arithmetic:


delays:


filters:

User Interface:
-uses mediator pattern to let the various gui areas (blocks-diagram editor, tree view, module gui 
 holder) communicate with each other without explicitly refering to each other
