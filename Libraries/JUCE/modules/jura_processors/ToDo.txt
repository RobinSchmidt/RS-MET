AudioPlugin:  
-store values of MetaParameters...this may have to go into AudioModule and there, we
 should store MetaParameters only for the top-level module - maybe have a flag: 
 storeMetaParameters that is false by default and gets set to true when an AudioModule
 gets wrapped into an AudioPlugin
-make cross coupling of meta-controlled parameters work
-notify host about (Meta) parameter changes
-allow to optionally map midi controllers to meta-parameters

AudioModuleChain: use inherited childModules array instead of "modules"

RSlider: make default-values and enter-value available on right-click (it's currently only
 available in subclass AutomatableSlider)

ParameterManager: rename functions to addParameter, removeParameter

State load/save widget set: click on textfield should open menu with files in current folder

GenericAudioModuleEditor: complete widget arrangement (buttons, boxes)

Enveloper:
-check, why it goes through release twice when there's no loop active
-maybe make a plugin that uses two or three envelopes to test the multi-editor
 (perhaps a dual ladder filter)

General:
-use the "virtual" qualifier for methods more conservatively - only when overriding is needed
-move more functions from public into protected, avoid acquiring mutex locks inside protected
 functions (they are supposed to be called from public functions which already hold the mutex)
-take more care about const correctness in declarations
