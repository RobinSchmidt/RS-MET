AudioModule:  
-absorb these controller-to-xml functions into the class
-add MetaParameter attachment settings to the xml state

AudioModuleChain: use inherited childModules array instead of "modules"
RSlider: make default-values and enter-value available on right-click (it's currently only
 available in subclass AutomatableSlider)

ParameterManager: rename addParameter, removeParameter

GenericAudioModuleEditor: complete widget arrangement (buttons, boxes)

Enveloper:
-check, why it goes through release twice when there's no loop active
-maybe make a plugin that uses two or three envelopes to test the multi-editor
 (perhaps a dual ladder filter)
