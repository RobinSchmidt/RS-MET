Bugs:
-on "Undo" in Reaper (to undo a parameter change), the widgets are not updated
 -Reaper's "Undo" calls AudioPlugin::setStateInformation, there is the line
  ParameterObserver::guiAutomationSwitch = false;
  which temporarily turns off receiving notifications for all widgets globally 
  and that's why the widgets don't update. i'm sure, what's the best way to 
  fix that ...why do we switch that off anyway...is was to solve some other 
  issue...figure out...


AudioPlugin:  

MetaParameters:
-make renamable via GUI 
-have an Auto-Rename feature (renames to assigned parameter's name)
-allow to optionally map midi controllers to meta-parameters
-fix updating of the frequency-response plot in the Ladder when parameters are automated

AudioModuleChain: use inherited childModules array instead of "modules"

RSlider: 
-make default-values and enter-value available on right-click (it's currently only
 available in subclass AutomatableSlider)


ParameterManager: rename functions to addParameter, removeParameter

State load/save widget set: click on textfield should open menu with files in current folder

GenericAudioModuleEditor: complete widget arrangement (buttons, boxes)

Enveloper:
-check, why it goes through release twice when there's no loop active
-maybe make a plugin that uses two or three envelopes to test the multi-editor
 (perhaps a dual ladder filter)

General:
-use the "virtual" qualifier for methods more conservatively - only when overriding is needed
-move more functions from public into protected, avoid acquiring mutex locks inside protected
 functions (they are supposed to be called from public functions which already hold the mutex)
-take more care about const correctness in declarations
