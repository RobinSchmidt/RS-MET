-make a BreakpointEnvelope AudioModule with editor 
 -it just applies the envelope to the incoming signal
 -it may not terribly useful by itself but we need some context to drag over the 
  BreakpointModulator code
 -...but actually it might be even useful as a modulation plugin - we may also
  let it modulate pan and/or a (ladder) filter
 -..yes - make two plugins - one that only modulates amplitude and one that modulates
  amplitude, pan and filter - with the 2nd, we can test the multi-editor
