AutomatableModule/AudioModule
 refactor: 
 -midi stuff should become part of AudioModule
 -rename AutomatableModule into ParametrizedModule (or ParameterManager)
 -state management an child-modules become part of AutomatableModule
 -rename some functions: addParameter, removeParameter


AudioModuleChain: use inherited childModules array instead of "modules"
RSlider: make default-values and enter-value available on right-click (it's currently only
 available in subclass AutomatableSlider)

-create a Shell plugin that allows an arbitrary number of AudioProcessors be chained one after
 another (maybe allow later modular routing)
 ->have all the RAPT audio processors as "BuiltIns"
 ->support also PlugIns (VST, AU, etc.)
 ->to be used as test and demo environment
 ->Name: Chainer
 ->see Mixsonic code

-refine GenericAudioModuleEditor (widget arrangement)

Enveloper:
-check, why it goes through release twice when there's no loop active
-maybe make a plugin that uses two or three envelopes to test the multi-editor
 (perhaps a dual ladder filter)
