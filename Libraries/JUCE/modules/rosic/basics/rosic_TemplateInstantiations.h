// This file contains typedefs for explicit template instantiations for templates from the RAPT 
// library. Sometimes we also create a subclass of a template call from RAPT in order to provide
// additional functionality such as converting between two doubles and rsFloat64x2 etc. to make it
// more convenient to use the classes
