  This class defines the user parameters and some other shared data for the BreakpointModulator class.

  \todo:
  -make time-stamps and levels key- and velocity dependent (important especially to make attack shorter for high 
   velocity while keeping the release as is)
  -try polynomial shapes (quadratic, cubic, quartic, pentic)
  -introduce a 'randomize levels' function which randomizes all the levels within a given range and 
   with a given quantization interval (allow also musical intervals here)
  -for tanh-shape us:
  tanh(x) = (exp(2*x)-1) / (exp(2*x)+1) instead of (exp(x)-exp(-x)) / (exp(x)+exp(-x))
   ... (equation from the stinchcombe article on moog ladders)... maybe there's a similar formula for sinh?
