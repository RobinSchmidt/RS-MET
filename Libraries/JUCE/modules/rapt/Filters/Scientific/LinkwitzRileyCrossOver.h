/** This class implements a pair of filters to split an incoming signal into a low an high band. 
The filters used here are of Linkwitz/Riley type which ensures a flat magnitude response of the 
recombined (summed) output. However, the recombined output signal will not reconstruct the input 
signal exactly. Instead, the recombined signal will be an allpass-filtered version of the input. 
Linkwitz/Riley filters are made from a series connection of two identical Butterworth filters which
implies that the magnitude-response is that of a Butterworth filter squared. In particular, the 
gain at the cutoff/crossover frequency is -6.02 dB because the Butterworth filter has a gain of 
-3.01 dB there.

Stability: it has been stability-tested (with highest slope of 96 dB/oct) for crossover-frequencies 
down to 20 Hz with sample-rates up to 800 kHz - beyond that (either higher sample-rate or lower 
crossover-frequency (or both), filters may become numerically unstable). */

/**
\todo: write a class PerfectReconstructionCrossover that uses the following algorithm:

yL1 = LP1(x);   yH1 =       (x  -  yL1);  // x: input, yL1: 1st lowpass output, yH1: 1st highpass output, LP1: 1st lowpass filter
yL2 = LP2(yL1); yH2 = yH1 + (yL1 - yL2);  // yL2: 2nd lowpass output. yH2: 2nd highpass output
yL3 = LP3(yL2); yH3 = yH2 + (yL2 - yL3);
...etc.
the lowpass of the current stage is always applied the lowpass-output of the previous stage and the 
difference between the current lowpass-input and current lowpass-output is added to the 
highpass-output of the previous stage to form the highpass output of the current stage if we assume 
that x = yL1+yH1, then it follows that x = yL2+yH2 = yL3+yL3 = ...
this ensures that after any number of stages, the lowpass and highpass signals sum up to the 
original signal x however, the crossover frequency of the N-th order crossover will be different 
from the cutoff frequency of the individual 1st order stages -> we must adjust this -> find a 
cutoff scaler in terms of the total order N, we may also have to choose different cutoff 
frequencies for each stage -> this requires some research (find the 3-dB point of the N-th lowpass 
stage, scale the cutoff, etc...)

for an arbitrary N-th order crossover, the general algorithm may be stated as:
yL = lowpasses[0].getSample(x);
yH = x - yL;
for(int k = 1; k < N; k++)
{
  tmp = yL;
  yL  = lowpasses[k].getSample(yL);
  yH  = yH + (tmp - yL);
}
