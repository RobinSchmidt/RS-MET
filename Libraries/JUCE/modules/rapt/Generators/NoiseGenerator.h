/** A simple noise generator based on the linear congruential method. It generates uniformly 
distributed random number in the range that you can set up via setRange. By default, the range is 
between -1 and +1 (not 0 and 1 because this is meant for audio). The underlying integer pseudo 
random number generator is a linear congruential with period length of 2^32. It is based on 
Numerical Recipies in C (2nd edition), page 284. 

\todo 
-make subclasses that produce random numbers with different distributions, for example by adding
 outputs of the underlying basic generator and/or using waveshaping (maybe atanh, sinh could be
 useful shaping functions - something with low slope around the origina would contract values
 near the origin - high slope far away from the origin spreads them out - or maybe the rational
 mapping could be nice - try with FuncShaper - maybe we need a histogram analyzer for that)
-make a colored noise generator by using the SlopeFilter (in rosic - needs to be dragged to rapt)
