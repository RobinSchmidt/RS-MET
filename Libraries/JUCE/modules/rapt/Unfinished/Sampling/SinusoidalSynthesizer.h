/** A class for synthesizing a sound from a sinusoidal model via interpolating the instantaneous 
phases and amplitudes of the partials up to the sample-rate and driving an oscillator bank with 
these interpolated values. The (unwrapped) instantaneous phases are obtained by numerically 
integrating the instantaneous frequency values and then re-adjusting the results according to the 
stored phase values. Then, these instantaneous phase values (which are still at datapoint-rate) are 
interpolated up to the sample-rate. A similar but simpler procedure is done to the instantaneous 
amplitudes (there's no integration or unwrapping involved here). 

\todo:
This synthesis algorithm here is conceptually straightforward (and perhaps the most accurate? 
maybe - verify) but also quite expensive - implement a more efficient synthesis algorithm by 
generating main-lobes, iFFT, overlap/add as in Xavier Serra's SMS framework 

\todo:
Maybe include an option to not synthesize partials above the Nyquist frequency ...but what when a
partial goes above the limit only for a short moment?
