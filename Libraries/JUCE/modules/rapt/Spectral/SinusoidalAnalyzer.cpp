Ideas:

Peak-Tracking:
-maybe instead of looping over the tracks or peaks and greedily picking the closest match in the 
 respective other array, we should first collect all candidate matches and then decide which gets
 assigned to which based on the whole picture
-maybe a single peak can actually correspond to two tracks (if two tracks cross each other in the
 current frame) and maybe the peak's amplitude should then be split between the two tracks

Window:
-use a Dolph-Chebychev window and let the user only select the amplitude threshold for partials
 -the window will then be automatically tuned such the sidelobes are some reasonable margin below 
  the detection threshold (the margin has to figured out empirically - maybe 15 or 20 dB)
 -this, in turn, determines the mainlobe width of the window which in turn determines the required
  block-size
 ...soo in the high-level setup, the user just selects frequency resolution amplitude threshold 
 (and possibly the margin - but maybe not) and anything else can then be set up automatically
 ...nevertheless, provide the low-level setup anyway
 -maybe the allowed frequency deviation between two frames (which should be proportional to the 
  hopSize) can be set up in a way that is independent from the hopSize - maybe in Hz/s
  10 Hz/s means the frequency is allowed to change by 10 Hz in one second
 -but also have a look at the phase-response - make sure, the window doesn't mess up phase 
  measurement

-when a Chebychev window is used, we may make the block-size a function of the threshold (because
 the width of the mainlobe gets smaller with higher thresholds, we may choose smaller block-sizes
-use an adaptive (time-varying) amplitude threshold - high at the beginning (like -20..-30) - we
 can use smaller block-sizes in transient portions of the sound and therefore have better 
 time-resolution there. the idea is that at the beginning, all partials still have high amplitude,
 so a higher threshold is justified - later in the decay phase, we can use lower thresholds 
 (-40..-80) to not loose track of the more highly damped partials (...this applies mostly to
 decaying sounds, like guitar - for steady sounds, like flute, the situation is different)
-maybe we should first figure out, where the transients are via an onset-detector

//...if we go down that route, we may also use the obtained amplitude
// for refining our amplitude estimate...ok - for now, just leave the instantaneous phase

see here for window functions:

implement blackman-harris and maybe blackman-nutall, dolph-chebychev - i think, low sidelobes are
important for sinusoidal parameter estimation...maybe gaussian for frequency estimation? or use 
re-assignment?

Ideas for transformations:
-insert phase anomalies into partials - maybe at regular intervals, offset the phase by a certain
 dp (delta-phi) - this should impose some sort of periodic pattern, maybe a sort of robotization
 ...but maybe that time-interval of the phase anomalies could be different for different partials
 "Phase-Bumper"
