/** Given an array of strictly monotonically increasing but not necessarily equidistant abscissa
values in x and corresponding function values in y, this function fills the array yd with a
numeric approximation of the derivative for each x value. All arrays are of length N. To
compute the numeric derivative, we use a weighted average of the difference quotients left and
right to the data point:

               y[n] - y[n-1]          y[n+1] - y[n]
 yd[n] = wL * --------------- + wR * ---------------
               x[n] - x[n-1]          x[n+1] - x[n]

where the weights for the left and right difference quotients are determined by the distances
dxL = x[n]-x[n-1] and dxR = x[n+1]-x[n] as wL = dxR/(dxL+dxR), wR = dxL/(dxL+dxR), such that
the closer the x-axis value x[n-1] is to x[n], the more weight is given for the left quotient
and vice versa. The weights add up to unity. If extrapolateEnds is true, the function will use
linear extrapolation of the inner derivative values for the endpoints yd[0] and yd[N-1],
otherwise it will use the (divided) forward difference at 0 and the backward difference at
N-1. In a test with a sine function, the extrapolation gave more accurate results at the
endpoints compared to simple differences, so it's probably better to use extrapolation. */

/** Computes the numerical integral of a function defined by data points, i.e. the function:
\f[ F(x) = \int_c^x f(t) dt \f] where the lower integration limit c can be passed as a parameter 
into the function. Usage is similar to rsNumericDerivative. The parameter c can also be seen as an 
integration constant and determines yi[0] that shifts the overall resulting function up or down 
along the y-axis. */
