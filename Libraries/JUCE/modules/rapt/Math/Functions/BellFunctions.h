nonnegative: x >= 0. If your input value may be negative, you can just pass the absolute value,

/** This is a class for representing and evaluating bell shaped functions with adjustable center,
width and (relative) length of an inserted flat top zone. Picture this as cutting the bell into two
halves and dragging them apart while squeezing them along the x-axis (such that the overall width
stays the same) and inserting a constant value in between. The relative width of this flat top zone
is controlled by a parameter between 0 and 1 where 0 means no flat top zone and 1 reduces the whole
bell to a rectangular pulse. The shape of the transition is based on a prototype bell shaped 
function that you can pass as function pointer (suitable functions are those from the class 
rsPositiveBellFunctions, but you may also use others as well). This class here will then scale and 
shift the input according to your desired center value, width and flat-top length.  */
