To make it work, i had to tweak/hack the juce library a bit:

-juce_Image.h: removed "final" declaration from class



to update to a new version of juce, the follwoing steps are necessarry:
-download latest version of juce
-create a new git branch and switch to it
-replace content of the JUCE/modules folder (maybe keep the juce_VSTInterface.h)
-replace Projucer code and make it build (don't copy the JUCECompileEngine.dll)
 -making it build requires to set the juce module path and re-generate the IDE 
  project with the projucer itself (a binary version is usally included in the 
  juce distribution) 
 -changing the path involves setting it for one module, clicking on the 
  gear-symbol and then taking over that path for all other modules
-re-create projects for TestPluginJuce with the new projucer and make it build
 -juce::Image final declaration has to be removed (i have subclasses of it)
 -this will compile jura_framework
-make ToolChain build
-replace the PluginHost code and make it build
-merge the update branch with the master branch
