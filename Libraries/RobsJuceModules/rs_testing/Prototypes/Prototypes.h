/** Simulates the dynamics of a rotating rigid body around its three pricipal axes of intertia. If
they are all different, when it initially rotates around the axis of the middle/intermediate moment
of inertia with some small perturbation of having a rotational component around any of the other 
two axes, the rotation axis periodically flips over. This is known as the "tennis racket effect" 
because it also occurs when throwing up a tennis racket in a particular way. It is due to the 
rotation around the intermediate axis being an unstable equilibrium of the dynamic equations that
describe the rotation. Rotation around any of the other two principal axes (those with maximum and 
minimum moment of inertia) are stable equlibria.

/** A second order (2 poles, 2 zeros) filter implementation, whose internal state is represented as
a 2D vector, i.e. a point in the xy-plane. The state is updated by multiplying the current state
vector by a matrix (and adding the input value to both components). The output is computed as a 
linear combination of the state-vector's coordinates and the input. The state update matrix will 
have one of these two general forms:

  |p1 0 |     or:     r * |cos(w)  -sin(w)| 
  |0  p2|                 |sin(w)   cos(w)|

where in the first case, p1 and p2 are the two real poles and the x and y states decay 
exponentially and independently from each other when the input is switched off. In the second case,
the numbers r*cos(w), r*sin(w) are the real and imaginary parts of a pair of complex conjugate 
poles and we will see a spiraling/decaying rotation of the states when there's no input (anymore).
The filter structure can realize almost any biquad transfer function - the singular problematic 
case is when there are two equal real poles - in this case, they will be made artificially distinct 
by fudging them a bit. The effect of that fudging on the transfer function will be miniscule. The
advanatge of that filter structure is that it (presumably) responds well to modulation. */

Idea:
-a naive median filter would at each sample have to sort an array of delayed values and return the
 middle value of that sorted array
-sorting is an O(N*log(N)) process, so that would be the complexity per sample, which is bad
-a better implementation would insert the new incoming sample into an already sorted array - but 
 that involves shifting a lot of data around which is still O(N) - still bad
-instead, we keep the delayed samples organized as a max-heap, i.e. a binary tree that has the 
 property that for each node, the right child has the value >= and the left child a value <= the 
 value of the node in question
-inserting a new value and removing an old value from such a heap is O(log(N)) (i think, verify)
-the root of the tree/heap is always our desired output sample representing the current median
-when a new sample comes in, it has to be inserted into the heap and the oldest sample has to be 
 removed
-to do this, the filter keeps a pointer to the oldest node...

/** Class for representing an array A of data as binary heap with functions for establishing and

flat array A as a binary tree in the following way:

  left(i)   = 2*i + 1          left child index of index i
  reight(i) = 2*i + 2          right child index of index i
  parent(i) = (i-1) / 2        parent index of index i

Given that, the heap property says that for every node with index i (except the root), it holds 
that: 

  A[parent(i)] >= A[i]

Instead of >=, we could have also used <=. In the former case, we are dealing with a max-heap in 
the latter with a min-heap.

/** A class for representing a particular kind of string with which we can do some computations 
just like with numbers. The set of all such strings forms a group (see group theory). The group 
operation (which we call addition here) is to concatenate two strings and then delete all pairs of
equal characters, i.e. the string "aaab" would be reduced to "ab", one "aa" pair is deleted. The 
inverse element to each string is obtained by reversing it. Adding "cba" to "abc" like abc+cba 
results in abccba wich would subsequently be reduced to the empty string (the rule of deleting 
equal pairs is used as often as applicable). The additive neutral element is the empty string. */
