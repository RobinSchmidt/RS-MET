  // actually, it would be nice to absorb the final rotation as well
  // damn - this matrix sets the z-coordinate to 0 because it includes the final projection matrix 
  // it would be better to have one that pre

  // maybe make a class rsAffineTransform3D
  // -it should be able to create the unique rotation that rotates one vector into (the direction 
  //  of) another vector which can then be used to rotate viewing direction (d,e,f) into (0,0,1) 
  //  (catch singular case of original vector being (0,0,-1))
  // -compose a translation of viewer to the origin with this rotation (or maybe use simpler 
  //  formulas taking into account the simplicity of the target vector)
  // -a perspective projection can use the same transform as a parallel projection and just apply
  //  a different final step (instead of X = x, Y = y, do: X = x/(1+z/k), Y = y/(1+z/k), Eq. 33.8)
  //  (we may also do Z = z or Z = z/(1+z/k) if we want to retain depth information this is 
  //  proportional to  what is given on page 137 (proportionality constant is k))
  // -maybe it's best to re-derive 3.44 but without the final projection step, i.e. only the matrix
  //  product of the translation*rotation*translation (maybe even the last translation (by k)) is 
  //  not necessarry - k is irrelevant in parallel projections and for perspective, it can be 
  //  included in the final step)
  //  -so, (re)-derive a formula for T1*T2 (maybe using column-vectors and pre-multiplication) and
  //   for parallel projection, just strip off z and for perspective use X = x/(1+z/k), etc.
  //  -maybe compose T1*T2 with another rotation (around the line of sight (which is z after 
  //   T1*T2), rotation angle is related to the up-vector ...how?)
  //  -the parallel projection can (i think) indeed be expressed a 3D affine transform - so the
  //   perspective can be represented by that same affine transform followed by multiplying the
  //   end results by 1/(1+z/k) -> all of that can be done in one class with functions
  //   projectParallel(x,y,z, X,Y,Z); projectPerspective(x,y,z, X,Y,Z) where the latter calls the 
  //   former and multiplies results by 1/(1+z/k) (note how that factor goes to one when k goes to 
  //   inf as it should). of course, we can have versions of the "project" functions that don't 
  //   compute z when it's not needed  - for optimization
  //  -maybe have a function project(x,y,z,X,Y,Z, perspectivity = 0) where perspectivity = p = 1/k. 
  //   if p = 0, it reduces to a parallel projection, increasing p means increasing perspectivity 
  //   effects (i.e. shrinking of x,y according to z), if p != 0, scale x,y,z by 1/(1+p*z).
  //   the parameter p is the reciprocal of the distance of the observer to the viewing plane, 0
  //   corresponds to infinite distance and hence a parallel projection
  //  -maybe in perspective projections, we need to take care of cases where z < 0 (objects in 
  //   front of the z = 0 projection plane, or even worse z < k = 1/p (objects behind the observer)
  //   or z = k = 1/p (objects in the same plane as the observer -> division-by-zero)










  //...


  // idea: to derive the transformation coeffs, consider a plane which has as its normal the vector
  // that connects the camera to the viewing point. Each point is then projected onto this plane
  // ...dunno if this will work out...
  // transformation should be in such a way that the view plane normal (vpn) becomes the new 
  // z-axis

  // maybe we need to cast the problem into a sequence of affine transformations:
  // 1: translate camera to the origin
  // 2: apply a rotation that turns the viewing direction into the z-axis
  // 3: 
  // and the view up
  //    vector (VUP) into the y-axis

  // ...hmm...maybe figure it out in 2D-to-1D first and get the 3D-to-2D version by analogy

  // in the transformations and projections, page 109, there is a matrix given in 4D homogeneous
  // coordinates, see also some comments on 111-112 for a special case that needs to be catched

/*
terminology from Computer Graphics (Foley, ...)
VRP: view reference point (on the view plane)
VPN: view plane normal
VRC: viewing-reference coordinates (origin at VRP, n-axis/forward-axis is given by the VPN)
VUP: view up vector (v-axis, upward axis in VRC), u-axis is defined such that u,v,n for a 
     right-handed system
CW:  center of window, sometimes identical to VRP but not necessarily
WC:  window coordinates
COP: center of projection
DOP: direction of projection
PRP: projection reference point (specified in the VRC system)
NPC: normalized projection coordinates


VPD: view plane distance (from VRP? but this is supposed to be in the plane?)

Ideas:
-make a class for projecting N-dimensional vectors to 2D
 -each coordinate axis in ND space is projected onto an axis in 2D where the 2D projections are 
  distributed at equal angles from 0° to 180°/N:
  2D: x: 0° = 0*180/2, y: 90° = 1*180/2
  3D: x: 0° = 0*180/3, y: 60° = 1*180/3, z: 120° = 2*180/3
  4D: x: 0° = 0*180/4, y: 45° = 1*180/4, z:  90° = 2*180/4, w: 135° = 3*180/4
  ND: n-th axis: (n-1)*180/N
 -maybe generealize to k*(n-1)*180/N where k is an user-adjustable angle-squishing factor
  -for 3D and k=3/4, we get a y-axis at 45° and a z-axis at 90°
 -the projection of the n-th unit vector in ND is given by (cos(a_n), sin(a_n)) where
  a_n = k*(n-1)*180/N
