ToDo:
-implement addition and multiplication operators
-implement functions for derivative and integral, if possible, i.e. if the result is again a sum of 
 damped sines (i think so, but i'm not sure). The definite integral is just a number, so it can be
 computed anyway.
-implement efficient computation of an array of values by means of recursion
 -maybe this function should accumulate into the array, i.e. use +=, because in practice, we may 
  want to work with sums of damped sines
