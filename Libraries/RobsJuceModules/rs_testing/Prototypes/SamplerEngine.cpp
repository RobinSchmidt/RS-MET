Goals: 
-Implement (a subset of) the feature set of the sfz specification, perhaps with some extensions 
 that are specifically necessary for the drum sampler. The general architecture should be such 
 that it will possible (and hopefully easy) to implement the full feature set of sfz (and sfz2?) 
 later.
-It should be able to parse sfz files and set itself up accordingly.
-It should support different ways of streaming the audio - at least: 
   (1) all samples are preloaded into RAM
   (2) direct-from-disk streaming (DFD)
 To implement this, it should use some sort of suitable abstraction of an audio-streamer that can 
 be plopped in. At first, we implement just the (much simpler) preloading version but it should be
 straightforward to add DFD later.
-We need a sort of sample-pool containing all our sample-buffers along with their playback 
 parameters.
-In th sfz spec, the performance parameters defined for the whole instrument and for groups work as
 fallback values that can be overriden by respective values on a lower level of the hierarchy. The
 drum-sampler needs them to work in an accumulative fashion. For example a cutoff defined for a 
 region should be used as is and the cutoff for the group should be for a 2nd filter through which 
 the signal of the whole group is passed. That's a different semantic. In the original sfz-spec, 
 the group cutoff would just have been overriden by the region setting (i think -> verify). Maybe 
 we should have switches like: goup/instrumentSettingsAccumulate
-Loop-points and start/end points shall be floating point numbers. When parsing an sfz file, we 
 just split the number string into pre-dot and post-dot part, parse them separately and store the 
 post-dot part in a double (or TPar) and the pre-dot part in an integer. That way, we won't suffer 
 precision loss for numbers bigger pre-dot part. This should be downward compatible with sfz spec 
 (which has only integer loop points (i think -> verify))


Notes:

Maybe numChannels should be a member variable instead of being passed to process. If the loaded
sample has a different number of channels than what we need to produce as output, we need sensible 
rules to deal with that situation, such as: If output is stereo and sample is mono: both outpus 
receive the same signal. If the situation is reversed, just the left channel goes into the mono 
output. Maybe something like: outChannel[i] = sampleChannel[i % numSampleChannels]. I think, the
most common situations are output: stereo, sample: mono or stereo. But it would be nice, if we 
could handle more general situations in a sensible way. For stereo-to-mono, it could be argued 
that a mix of both channels would be more sensible - but that rule doesn't seem to generalize 
well. But maybe we should have an (optional) exceptional rule for mono outputs to use a mixdown of
all channels.

may use SampleBuffer, SamplePlaybackParameters
