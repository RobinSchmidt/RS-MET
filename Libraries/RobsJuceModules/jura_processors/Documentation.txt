Classes
=======

AudioModule is the main baseclass for all audio modules that are available in ToolChain, for example
the LadderFilter, Straightliner, etc. - they are all specific kinds of an AudioModule. ...tbc...

ModulatableAudioModule is a subclass of AudioModule and ModulationParticipant which adds features 
for freely routable modulations ...tbc...

AudioModuleWithMidiIn is a subclass of ModulatableAudioModule and rsMidiMessageDispatcher which adds
features to handle incoming midi events in order to respond to them. All instruments are derived 
from that class but also some effects (well - not sure - but at least that may make sense)...tbc...



Call sequences
==============






ToolChain::handleMidiMessage(...)
---------------------------------

ToolChain has a chain of submodules and passes the incoming MIDI messages to these submodules. The 
submodules may themselves be either monophonic or polyphonic which complicates the matter. For 
example, in a simple patch, there could be a polyphonic envelope generator and a polyphonic 
oscillator whose amplitude is controlled by the envelope. That means that envelope and oscillator
need to receive the midi events. For example, a noteOn would trigger the envelope, reset the 
oscillator and set up its frequency. For that to work polyphonically, ToolChain uses an object of
class rsVoiceManager ...TBC...
