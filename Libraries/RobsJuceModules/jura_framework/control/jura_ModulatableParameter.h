The Modulation System


How to use it:

Client code that wants to use the modulation system for plugin parameters must do the following 
things:

-derive its AudioModule from ModulatableAudioModule (or from a subclass thereof)
-somewhere have a ModulationManager object lying around, a pointer to that object should be passed
 to the constructor call of the ModulatableAudioModule baseclass
-use objects of type ModulatableParameter for its parameters
-use objects of type rsModulatableSlider for the sliders of the to-be-modulated parameters
-every ModulationSource that should be available must be registered with the ModulationManager
 object
-before producing a sample, your AudioModule must call applyModulations on the ModulationManager
 object


How it works:

There are 4 main classes that are relevant for the system: ModulationSource, ModulationTarget, 
ModulationConnection and ModulationManager. ModulationSource and ModulationTarget have a common 
baseclass ModulationParticipant for factoring out some common stuff but the client is usually not 
concerned with this. Sources are things like envelope generators, LFOs, etc. For example, to make 
an envelope generator available for the modulation system, it would have to be a subclass of 
ModulationSource. The subclass is then required to implement the purely virtual 
getModulatorOutputSample() method. There, it is supposed to compute a new output sample of the 
modulator (that value will later be gathered by the ModulationManager and used for modulating 
things). ModulationTargets are typically parameters of some audio-processing algorithm such as the
cutoff frequency of a filter. Typically, clients will only use ModulatableParameter which is a 
subclass of ModulationTarget and Parameter. A ModulationTarget subclass is required to implement 
doModulationUpdate() which is also called per sample. There, they must use the "modulatedValue" 
member (which was set up by the ModulationManager and now - inside the doModulationUpdate call - 
it contains the parameter value with all modulations applied. A ModulatableParameter will call its 
valueChangeCallback (inherited from Parameter), which, for example, may cause a call to 
setCutoff(modulatedValue) on some core filter object. ModulationConnection represents a connection 
between a given ModualtionSource and ModulationTarget. It also contains the strength of the 
connection, i.e. the depth by which some source modulates some target. The ModulationManager 
maintains arrays of all available sources and targets and, importantly, all the connections. It can
also create new and remove existing connections. It is also responsible for calling 
updateModulationValue on all registered ModulationSources and doModulationUpdate on all affected 
ModulationTargets - between these sequences of calls, it gathers up all the source-outputs, and 
applies them to their targets - as defined via the connections.



old:

Idea to extend the same concept of MetaParameters to a modulation system for synthesizers:

ModulationSource:
-provide interface to pull out a current value
-subclasses can be fixed values (like gui parameter sliders), envelope generators, low frequency 
 oscillators, step sequencers, midi-note values, etc.
-At each sample, the first thing to do is to compute all current values of all existing modulation 
 sources. This should be done in a central place in some higher level object (maybe some subclass 
 of AudioModule)

ModulationTarget:
-is typically some (lower level) dsp algorithm parameter such as a cutoff frequency of a filter
-keeps a list of assigned sources
-keeps a pointer to ModulationManager where it can sign up to receive inputs from sources

ModulationManager:
-allows ModulationsTargets to de/register themselves to ModulationSources

similarities to MetaParameters:
-needs similar sign-up system on the gui (right-click - assign, etc.)

differences to MetaParameters:
-each modulation target can be connected to any number of modulation sources (many-to-many instead 
 of one-to-many)
-uses pull rather than push mechanism to update the dependent parameter

feedback:
-it is desirable to be able for (parameters of) ModulationsSources themselves be modulated by 
 other ModulationSources or even by their own output
-maybe the parameters of a ModulationSource (like an LFO freq) should be subclasses of 
 ModulationTarget ...or just BE a ModulationTarget object - or maybe we'll need a class
 ModulatableParameter

maybe make the class hierarchy like this:
Parameter <- MetaControlledParameter <- ModulatableParameter <- PolyphonicParameter

ToDo:
-It doesn't work in Elan's SpiralGenerator - why? maybe it has to do with creation order? There,
 the modulators whould modulate parameters of their parent module, in ToolChain it's the sibling
 modules - and no sources or targets are created in the constructor
 Solution:
 -call setModulationManager in constructor b4 creating sources and targets
 -..
-figure out what happens if the user changes the range of depthParam - how will this affect the 
 meta-value, how can we make sure that the depth parameter is always consistent with its attached 
 metaparameter? how is patch recall affected?
-optimize, where possible - maybe the scaler can be multiplied into the depth (maybe use a 
 scaledDepth member)
 -maybe the ModulationManager should maintain an array usedSources and iterate only over that in
  applyModulations (similar to the treatment of affectedTargets - maybe call the arrays 
  connectedTargets and connectedSources to make the parallelism obvious)
-let the depth be controlled by key and/or velocity - or better, make key and vel available as
 ModulationSource and let Depth-parameters be ModulationTargets (i.e. ModulatableParameters)
 ...or maybe not the midi key/vel values but something more physical, for example Note-Frequency
 and Amplitude, i.e. freq = pitchToFreq(key+pitchbend), amp = vel/127.

/** Baseclass for polyphonic modulation sources.

...

The rules for applying polyphonic sources to monophonic targets are as follows:

  -If at least one voice is active (i.e. at least one note is playing), the monophonic target 
   receives the modulation signal from the newest active voice, i.e. the latest triggered note that
   is still being held.
  -If no voice is playing, the monophonic target receives whatever your overriden renderModulation
   function produces. But you don't have to override it in which case it receives zero, because 
   that's what the inherited baseclass function will then produce. 

So, your subclass is only *required* to override renderVoiceModulation and it *may optionally* 
also override renderModulation in cases where it's not appropriate to produce a zero modulation 
when no voice is playing (which, i guess, is uncommon - so mostly it should suffice to override
renderVoiceModulation -> less boilerplate).

...i'm not sure, if that's the best way to do it - experimentation is needed
maybe it could also make sense to continue producing the last signal value from the latest voice
after it was turned of - i.e. always use value of the newest voice, regardless whether this voice 
is still active or not. but his implies that the sound of a patch will depend on the latest note
that was ever produced - even after the note has long been died out - that may be bad for sound 
design: the synth is in a certain state (due to the last played note), the user creates a sound,
saves it and when they reload it at another day, it will sound different, because the synth is in
a different state. that would be bad! ..it seems like having a state which depends on the last 
played note and which affects the sound output is not a good idea.
