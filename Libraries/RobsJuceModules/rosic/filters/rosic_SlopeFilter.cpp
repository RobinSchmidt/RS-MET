ToDo:
-Make a version for RAPT that makes this one obsolete (this one here can then be realized as 
 subclass of an explicit instantiation if that is needed for legacy reasons):
 -Should use template parameters for parameters/coeffs and signals using the common pattern. That
  obviates the need for seprate state variables for L/R stereo channels.
 -Should normalize either as we do now, normalize at some user-defined "hinge"-frequency (or 
  pivot-frequency), defaulting to 1 kHz or normalize at DC or Nyquist. Maybe a "passive" mode 
  should normalize at DC for downward slopes and at nyquist for upward slopes. The intention here
  was actually to normalize at 1 kHz but experiments show that the actual hinge is slightly above
  one kHz (at 1012 Hz for fs=48kHz) - may have to do with bilinear warping? Normalizing at Nyquist
  may not play nicely with higher sample-rates in the sense that total gain depends on sample-rate
  -> check that before implementing such modes.
 -Maybe it should make use of rsBiquad or rsBiquadCascade, either via subclassing or via embedding.
 -We could have a class rsSlopeFilterChain that chains M identical slope filters each realizing
  only one M-th of the desired slope. Rationale: For higher slopes, the approximation to a straight
  line gets worse using only 4 poles. Realizing them via a cascade works better. Maybe the slope of
  a single stage should only realize up to 10 or 12 dB/oct
-Try to make a class rsBiSlopeFilter with adjustable center freq and bandwidth (like a bandpass)
 and two slope parameters (for the lowpass and the highpass)
