ExprEval 3.3
------------
- Added support for arbitrary data objects to be passed to functions
  with the '@' operator.  The expression library itself does not have
  any understanding of the arbitrary data, but the functions can.

ExprEval 3.2
------------
- Added Exception::GetType method to determine the type of error
  without needing many catch statements.

ExprEval 3.1
------------
- Removed Exception::what due to language problems.  Each application should
  do testing and report the exception to the user itself, in whatever language
  it needs.
- Added Exception::GetStart and Exception::GetEnd to report where in the
  expression string the error occurs when parsing.
- Added Exception::GetValue to get the name of the object, function, etc
  that is responsible for an exception, depending on the exception itself
- In header files, replaced 'std::X' with '::std::X'
