Modulation system:

- Define and implement parsing for modulation routing opcodes.

- Figure out what the correct behavior with regard to start/delay is - should we output zero or
   start during the delay phase? We need to test this using a reference implementation like 
   sfz+.

- Maybe we should handle the fixed/hardwired modulations, i.e. filegN, ampegN, pitchegN, 
  opcodes as follows:
  - Implement a function translateHardwiredOpcodes that is supposed to be called at the end of
    setFromSfz and should do the following:
    - Figure out maxN, the maximum N in the existing egN opcodes.
    - Translate the filegN, ampegN, pitchegN to egN opcodes with N values above maxN.
    - Translate filegN_depth, pitchegN_depth to appropriate modulation routing opcodes.
  - Advantages:
    - We can handle all envelopes in a unified way. In particular, we don't need separate arrays
      for ampEnvs, pitchEnvs, filterEnvs in the DspPool.
  - Disadvantages:
    - When writing the state to an sfz file, we lose the information about what egN opcodes 
      formerly actually were hardwirded opcodes. Unless we somehow store that information in the
      egN opdcodes.
