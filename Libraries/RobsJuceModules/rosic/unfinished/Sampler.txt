The RS-MET sampler engine is built around popular sfz which is a text-based file format to specify 
sample-based instruments.



Opcode support
##############



SFZ v1
======

Player
------

sample, lokey, hikey, lovel, hivel, delay, offset, loop_mode (partial), transpose, tune, 
pitch_keycenter, pitch_keytrack

Filters
-------
filN_type (partial), cutoffN, resonanceN, filN_keytrack, filN_keycenter, filN_veltrack, eqN_gain,
eqN_freq, eqN_bw

Amplifiers
----------

Notes
-----

For some opcodes that include an index such as eqN_gain, cutoffN, etc. the N is optional when N=1 
to cater for the fact that sfz1 only allowed one of those devices. These are:

filN_type, cutoffN, resonanceN, filN_keytrack, filN_keycenter, filN_veltrack, volumeN, panN, 
widthN, positionN
