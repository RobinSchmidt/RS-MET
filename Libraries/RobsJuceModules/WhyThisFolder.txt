custom juce modules don't work anymore with new projucer:
https://forum.juce.com/t/projucer-5-4-1-doesnt-allow-user-modules-to-be-inside-juce-modules-folder/30363

i actually had to remove and re-add the modules by using
"Add module from a specified folder"
in the Projucer - fortunately, after adding the first one, the other ones can 
be added more easily by Add a module -> Exporter paths 
...even if that doesn't seem to make sense...
