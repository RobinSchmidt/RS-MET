custom juce modules in the main juce modules folder don't work anymore with new 
projucer:
https://forum.juce.com/t/projucer-5-4-1-doesnt-allow-user-modules-to-be-inside-juce-modules-folder/30363

it does not help to just change the path in Projucer - i actually had to remove and 
re-add the modules by using "Add module from a specified folder" - fortunately, after 
adding the first one, the other ones can be added more easily by 
Add a module -> Exporter paths  (...even if that doesn't seem to make sense...)

oh - going to Modules "gear-symbol" page (the gear symbol at the bottom of the Modules column) 
and using the path copy/paste functions also worked
