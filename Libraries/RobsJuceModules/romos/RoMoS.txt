RoMoS is an acronym for Rob's modular synthesizer.

Some technical details:
RoMoS distuishes 3 processing stages. The first one is the input stage which is useful, for 
example, to pre-process incoming events to build sequencers, appregiators, etc. The second stage is 
polyphonic and is the place where most of the main instrument body resides. The outputs of the 
voices are added and this sum goes into the third and last stage which is monophonic and can be 
used to apply master effects. Unless spefified otherwise, the outputs of the modules are evaluated 
according to the positions of the modules inside the structure beginning at the top-left and 
proceeding to the bottom right. The x-coordinate has higher priority which means that if some 
module A that is to the left of some other module B but possibly below module B, module A will 
still be evaluated before module B. If two modules are exactly at the same position (a situation 
which you should avoid), the evaluation order is undefined. Alternatively, you can explicitely 
specify the evaluation order yourself. Feedback paths are possible, but there will be an implicit 
unit delay in such feedback paths due to the fact that an output of a module that depends on it own 
input can only be computed when - so to speak - the output is already known before computing the 
output - an obviously impossible thing (quite generally in digital signal processing), so we must 
resort to use the output from the previous sample instant instead.
