for the implementation of output modules, there are the following variants:

1)
-the parent container allocates the memory for the output signal
-the container sets up the "audioOutputs" pointer for all its embedded output modules (update on re-alloction)
-for siblings of the container, the container itself appears as the source module (as in being stored as 
 sourceModulePointer in the connected target modules)
-when the container, re-allocates memory, it notifies all direct siblings about that, so they can update their
 input-signal pointers and stride variables, etc.

implications:
-the output modules can straightforwardly be extendend to perform downsampling
-connecting
