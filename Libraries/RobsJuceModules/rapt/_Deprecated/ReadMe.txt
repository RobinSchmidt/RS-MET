This folder constains files with code that was once useful but is now obsolete due to newer and
hopefully better implementations of the same functionality. However, the old code should not (yet) 
be deleted completely. I still want to keep it around for reference purposes and just in case. It's 
a sort of code attic.

The files in this folder should not be seen by the compiler. They are not included by the unity 
build files. (ToDo: verify that!)
