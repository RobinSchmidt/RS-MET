Autonomous Modulator ("AutoMod"?):
Often, it is desirable to not create a modulation signal from scratch
(using oscillators, envelope generators, etc.) but rather derive it from the 
input signal itself. If we are running oscillators, etc., we always have a 
kind of absolute time-reference, making the system non-autonomous - i.e. the
output signal will depend on when was the last time, we resetted our 
oscillator phase. To avoid this, the idea is to derive a modulation signal
from the input signal itself (and/or output or, more generaly weighted, sum 
between those). Perhaps, we could somehow shred the input signal to turn it 
into a kind of white noise (maybe via fmod) and then apply a narrow bandpass
filter to that to get a kind of signal-derived pseudo-sinusoidal modulation
signal. Maybe somehow, we could also use a level detector in this setup to
make sure that the modulation signal has always about the same level.

maybe try something based on:
  y = f(x) = (a*exp(x) + b*exp(-x)) / (c*exp(x) + d*exp(-x))
this can be solved for x, giving:
  x = 0.5*log((y*d-b) / (a-y*c))
