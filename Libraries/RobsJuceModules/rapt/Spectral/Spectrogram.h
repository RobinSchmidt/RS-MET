-maybe rename to rsSpectrogramProcessor - a spectrogram itself is actually just a matrix of 
 complex values...or magnitude/phase values....but what about re-assignment? there may be 
 re-assigned spectrograms
-i think, i have implemented analysis and (re)synthesis in a single class rather than two separate
 classes (like with the sinusoidal model) in order to allow for identity resynthesis with arbitrary
 windows (the demodulation procedure needs to know both windows - analysis and synthesis)
-implement move contructors for rsArray and rsMatrix  */

  window products. The demodulation step is for undoing this modulation such that an identity 
  analysis/resynthesis roundtrip is possible even with windows that do not satsify these nice 
  "add up to unity" properties. With, for example, the (the "zn" version of) the Hanning window 
  and a hop-size equal to blockSize/4, such demodulation should not be necessarry because in this
  case, the windows indeed do add up to unity, so you may save some computation time by not doing 
  this step. That's why it can be switched on and off by client code - and for testing purposes. 

  ToDo: even with the zn-hanning window it doesn't yet work right because it currently seems to 
  add up not to unity but to some other constant (1.5 in case of H = B/4 - we seem to miss a 
  scaling somewhere..... also, at the moment, there are transient artifacts at the start and
