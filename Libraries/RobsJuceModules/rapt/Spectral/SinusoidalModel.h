/** Data structure to hold and edit the instantaneous parameters of a sinusoidal partial at one 
instant of time. A datapoint is defined by its time-stamp, an instantaneous frequency, 
instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous phase value (wrapped into -pi..pi). It may seem a bit 
redundant to store instantaneous frequency and phase because both values are related (phase is the
integral of frequency) but it turns out that the frequency is useful for two purposes: first, to 
unwrap the phase values (which is eventually needed for synthesis - at least, when an oscillator 
bank is used) and second, to provide target values for the phase-derivative in an Hermite 
interpolation scheme for the instantaneous phase. 

It's conceivable to alternatively store unwrapped phase directly but that would suffer from 
degrading precision at later time-instants because more and more of the floating point precision 
will be used up by the 2*k*pi part of the unwrapped phase. That could be solved by storing the 
wrapped phase and the integer k for the 2*k*pi part. However, storing the instantaneous frequency 
along with the phase is pretty much standard in the sinusoidal modeling literature. We must then
reconstruct the k heuristically - but that ususally works and as a plus, as said, we also get 
proper target values for phase derivatives for interpolation. */

todo: maybe allow the time to be represented in samples or seconds - samples may have numerical
advantages in computations, when the time-stamps are at integers or half-integers - maybe have a
sampleRate member - if it is zero (or nan or whatever special value), it means that time-stamps 
are in seconds, otherwise in samples at the given sample rate

todo: currently, the partials are in no particular order - maybe order them somehow (perhaps by 
start-time and then by frequency - or maybe by amplitude or even a psychoacoustic "importance"
measure?) . yes - it would be interesting to have a getPartialImportance() function that analyzes
according to amplitude, masking, etc. - can be used to "simplify" models - but maybe that should be
done in a dedicated class. we could also "sparsify" models by downsampling the partials datapoint 
density - we could remove datapoints whose information is well reconstructed by the interpolation 
process - we could measure the importance of a datapoint by reconstructing with and without it and
measure the amplitude and phase difference at the instant of the datapoint in the interpolated
trajectories - but that will depend on the selected interpolation - maybe a model should also 
contain data about its prefered interpolation mode
