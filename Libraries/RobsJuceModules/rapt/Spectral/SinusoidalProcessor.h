/** Baseclass for processing data of a sinusoidal model. Subclasses of that can be injected into
(re)synthesis pipeline to modify the data in order to achieve various effects. Two sorts of 
processes can be injected at two points in the synthesis pipeline: first, you can modify the 
model data itself and second, you can modify the (interpolated) trajectories for instantaneous
amplitude and phase. The first process operates at whatever (in general non-uniform) rate the
data of the model happens to be defined and the second process operates at the target sample-rate. 

todo: maybe it's better to make two different baseclasses for these two types of processes - maybe
we should have a sort of facade class that encapsulates the analyzer(s), the synthesizer(s), a 
chain of data processors and a chain of trajectory processors

The baseclass also defines a couple of static functions that fullfill basic processing tasks that 
are required already in the analysis stage but don't really fit there very well because they may
be useful in other contexts as well. */

  2*pi. This is helpful to remove a bias in the estimated frequency values that may have occured 
  during analysis, so it is a recommended post-processing step to refine the frequency estimates. 
  Such a bias can result in temporary phase desynchronization issues of a resynthesized signal with
  respect to the original signal, leading to sinusoidal bursts in the resiudal - which are clearly 
  undesirable. Such desync bursts would occur whenever the accumulated frequency bias crosses a 
  multiple of pi (i think - verify). */

  // inconsistency), because phase errors don't accumulate, so we can assume that they are more or 
  // less correct at each datapoint (which is not true for accumulated freq, if there's a bias in
