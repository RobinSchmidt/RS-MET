// move to the "Data" folder
// this file contains functions for sorting arrays, finding elements and related stuff
// maybe wrap into a class or two classes rsSort, rsSearch
// todo: rename lessThan, defaultLess, etc to "before" - because x may come before y even if x > y 
//       because one may want to sort in descending order
// todo: let the less comparator be a std::function, rename to rsLess, have also rsGreater, 
// rsLessOrEqual, rsGreaterOrEqual (or maybe derive the less-or-equal condition from:
// equal(a, b) = !less(a,b) && !less(b,a); lessOrEqual(a,b) = less(a,b) || equal(a,b)
// (the logic can be optimized/simplified)
// add binary search functions (there's an implementation elsewhere in the library)


// maybe implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothsort see also

is a binary tree which is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest which is
filled from the left up to a point. The value at a node is always greater than or equal to the
values at the child nodes. Thus, the largest element is found at the root. When representing
such a tree as array, we use the following convention: array[0] is the root, array[2*i+1] is the
left child of node i, array[2*i+2] is the right child of node i. The complexity is O(n).

at i becomes itself a max-heap. heapSize is the number of elements in the array for which the
max-heap property holds, so heapSize <= length. The complexity is O(log(n))

is now found at array[0] and can be seen as the root of the max-heap. We may now exchange it
with the last array element to put the largest element into the last position (where it should
be). Due to the exchange, the new root now violates the max-heap property, but for its
child-nodes, the max-heap property remains unchanged. We may thus invoke maxHeapify to restore
the max-heap property of the root node (let it float down). Then we iterate the invokation of
maxHeapify for subarrays with linearly shrinking size. The (worst case) complexity is
O(n*log(n)).
