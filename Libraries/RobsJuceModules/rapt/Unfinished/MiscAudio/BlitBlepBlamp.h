/** UNDER CONSTRUCTION


A generic implementation of the "BLEP" (= (B)and (L)imited st(EP)) technique for anti-aliasing
step discontinuities in a signal and/or its derivatives. Discontinuities in the signal itself show 
up as steps and produce spectra with a 6 dB/oct spectral roll-off, discontinuties in the first 
derivative show up as corners and produce spectra with a 12 dB/oct roll-off and so on. The basic 
idea is to take the difference between a bandlimited step (i.e. an integrated sinc function) and a 
naive step (this difference is called the residual) and add that residual to the output signal.

If a discontinuity happens between the previous sample n-1 and the current sample n, you should 
announce that event to the object by calling prepareForImpulse/prepareForStep/prepareForCorner 
immediately before the call to getSample at index n. The object will then prepare the appropriate
correction signals and apply them in subsequent calls to getSample. In order to be able to correct 
past samples as well, a delay is introduced. When announcing a discontinuity, you need to tell the 
object the fractional delay (how long ago is the instant of the discontinuity with respect to 
sample index n in upcoming call to getSample - if the discontinuity occured at continuous time 
n-frac, you should pass frac) and the size of the discontinuity. 




make also rsTableMinBlit/rsTableMinBlep/rsTableMinBlamp
rsPolyLinBlep/rsPolyLinBlamp

...all thes variations should have the same interface (as far as possible) such that client code
can conveniently interchange them - maybe factor out a common baseclass

maybe name the file DiscontinuityBandLimiters and have various classes with the various variants
in a single file

// -maybe try some other polynomial approximations - maybe based on directly matching function 
//  values and derivative values to the ideal analytic bandlimited discontinuities (based on the
//  Si function)
// -try to make a 3-sample delay version with the next higher order B-spline and Lagrange 
//  interpolators (it may require to re-derive the formulas for the 1- and 2-sample version to see
//  the general pattern)...maybe try even higher orders...4 samples delay is still a quite small
//  number...but maybe the cost of the polynomial evaluation may become too expensive...the whole
//  thing will scale with d^2 where d is the delay in samples (we need to compute 2*d correction
//  samples and the degree of the polynomial also increases linearly with d) ...that's an advantage
//  of the table-based versions - they scales linearly with d - so maybe teh general reccomendation 
//  should be: for (very) small bleps, use polynomials, otherwise tables
// -as for (table-based) MinBlep vs LinBlep:
//  -i think, the LinBlep can be overall shorter because the window is only unilateral
//  -the MinBlep has a fixed (3 sample) delay, independent from kernel length
//  -the LinBlep has less overshoot (but maybe with other filter-designs (Bessel), we can get rid
//   of the overshoot in the MinBlep, too)
// -maybe write a wrapper class that lets client code select the type of the blep (min/lin/poly) at
//  runtime and also conforms to the general blep interface - can be used during development to
//  experiment with various variants and later be swapped for a fixed choice (so it doesn't have to 
//  be efficient - it's just for experimentation to help select the best blep for the particular
//  application)
