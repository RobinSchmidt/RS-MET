/** Implements bidirectional filtering, which means the signal is first passed through the filter
in normal (forward) direction and then passed through the same filter again in opposite
(backward) direction. As a result of this forward/backward application of the same filter, the
magnitude response of the filter is squared and the phase response cancels to zero. A zero phase
response is desirable whenever we want to preserve time domain characteristics of the signal,
because certain time-domain features are better preserved that way. The filters may run not only
once (forward/backward) over the signals, but optionally also multiple times. Running the same
filter bidirectionally multiple times changes the shape of the envelope of the impulse-response
in a way so as to approach a Gaussian shape with more and more passes. It will also raise the
magnitude response to a power (given by the number of passes) and spread the impulse response out
in time, but this time-spreading (and to some extent, the magnitude powering) can be compensated
by choosing larger bandwidths for the single-pass filter to begin with (this compensation is done
internally here). The closer the shape approximates the Gaussian, the smaller the product of the
filter's time-domain width and frequency-domain width will be. When the shape is an exact
Gaussian, the this time-frequency product will be at its theoretical minimum value, determined
by the time-frequency uncertainty principle. So, typically, more passes are better, but there
will be a point of diminishing returns because the Gaussian shape is approached rather quickly.
The sweet spot seems to be somewhere between 10 and 20 passes [maybe elaborate this in terms of
decrease of time-frequency product].

/** A class with a collection of functions to find the zero-crossings in a signal, possibly with
subsample precision. The algorithm for subsample precsision location works by looking at the
sample values before and after the zero crossing (which actually happens somwhere between the two
sample instants) and fitting a polynomial to the sample values around the zero crossings and
finding the root of the interpolating polynomial. The degree of the polynomial is determined by
the precision parameter p which is passed to some of the functions as: order = 2*p+1 and 2*p+2
points will be used. If p=0, it will just fit a straight line between the sample before and after
the zero and solve for the zero of this line. This is the lowest precision estimate. For higher
precision, the linear zero is used as initial guess in a Newton-iteration for finding the root of
the higher order polynomial interpolant. Typically, p=1 corresponding to a cubic interpolant
gives adequate results. I also tried to use the cubic spline (which does not necessarily pass
through the outer points but instead matches derivatives of neighbouring interpolants at the
inner points), but the cubic that goes through the points seemed to give better results.

\todo: Theoretically, the true zero in continuous time is given by the  zero-crossing of a
sinc-interpolant rather than a polynomial interpolant. Maybe, it's possible to use
windowed-sinc interpolation in conjunction with (derivative-free) root-finding, i.e. bisection
or something (or maybe the derivative of the sinc interpolant can be computed straightforwardly
together with the interpolant itself).
 -make a class rsInterpolatingFunction as subclass of rsUnivariateScalarFunction
 -from that, make subclasses rsInterpolatingPolynomial, rsInterpolatingSpline,
  rsInterpolatingSinc, etc.
 -maybe generalize for non-equidistant data
 -maybe optionally return values of a number of derivatives at the crossing

generalize to findValueCrossings that finds the crossing of an arbitrary value. to this end,
a constant term should be included in the root-finding process. */

\todo: maybe implement different interpolation strategies, such as linear, polynomial, with or
without (bidirectional) IIR prefiltering, etc.

\todo: let the user select the window function

For the choice of the window function, we must make a tradeoff between the width of the mainlobe
and the height of the sidelobes in the frequency domain. Narrower mainlobes give rise to a faster
transition from passband to stopband - so, narrower is better. Lower sidelobes will produce less
ripple in the passband (passband ripple leads to undesired boosting or attenuation of
frequencies) and also less ripple in the stopband (stopband ripple leads to leaking through of
frequencies which we actually want to block) - so, lower sidelobes are better. However, a
narrower mainlobe will typically give rise to higher sidelobes which is why there has to be a
tradeoff.
....explain this stuff further - how it relates to aliasing when downsampling and what it means
for upsampling

\todo maybe rename to rsSincInterpolator

It is recommended to use sinc kernel length of at least 8 samples, otherwise amplitude errors
will occur (i.e. the output signal is to quiet)...maybe we can compensate this effect


\todo: make the signal type a template parameter such that the class can be used for multichannel
signals

maybe, it would be more convenient, if these functions would deal with std::vector or rsArrayTools, so
client code doesn't have to bother with signal lengths

reorganize the RSAudio part of the library to have folders Processes, Realtime and Tools where
Tools contains the general stuff (math-formulas, filter design, etc.), Realtime contains all
realtime objects and Processes contains all nonrealtime processes which access the whole signal
at once

make a file Preliminary.h/cpp which contains classes and functions that are currently under
construction - currently we have a lot of such code here in this file which should eventually
be moved into appropriate places in the library

maybe rename class...it's more like a collections of functions, maybe a true Resampler class
