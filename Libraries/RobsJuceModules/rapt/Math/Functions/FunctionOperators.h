/** This file contains operators in the mathematical sense of the term. In mathematics, an operator
is an object that takes a function as input and returns another function as output. An example for
an operator could be "take the derivative" which turns f(x) into f'(x) or "multiply by input 
argument" which turns f(x) into x*f(x). The input- and output functions are represented as 
std::function objects. */

// todo: 
// -maybe make versions that take the forward and backward difference
// -maybe let h be automatically selected - it sould be selected such that we get the best 
//  numerical accuracy - using smaller h reduces the approximation error but increases the the 
//  cancellation error (subtracting similar numbers) - so there should be an optimal choice 
//  somewhere - maybe there's a formula for that optimal choice based on the machine epsilon and
//  x and f(x)?
// -advantage of forward/backward difference: only one evaluation of f, may be used at points where
//  the function is undefined in either of the two directions from the point

// todo: invert, numerical integral (definite and indefinite, the latter 
// needs a lower limit as parameter, the former both limits), 
// maybe implement a convolution (by some specific function), i.e.
// rsConvolve(const std::function<T(T)>& f, const std::function<T(T)>& g) - maybe the convolution
// integral should be limited to a finite range (i.e. finite instead of infinite integration 
// limits)
// maybe de-inline
//
// There are a couple of more defined in MathExperiments.cpp in the TestsRosicAndRapt project which
// are under construction and can eventually be integrated here.
