/** This class implements various (one-dimensional) root finding algorithms, i.e. it finds 
solutions to the equation f(x) = 0 for an arbitrary given function f(x). For more generality, the
right hand side does not actually need to be equal to zero but can be any target value, so it 
actually finds solutions to f(x) = y for given f(x) and given y. This little addition to standard 
textbook root-finding algorithms doesn't change much algorithmically (we just need to subtract the 
target value in each function evaluation), yet adds a lot to the flexibility. Some algorithms 
require the user to pass an initial interval that is assumed to bracket the root, others require an
initial estimate of the root.

  iteration, the size of the interval is halved. The order of convergence is linear (in each

  point where a line between (xLeft,yLeft), (xRight,yRight) crosses the x-axis. Convergence is
  typically (for smooth functions, that are well approximated by a line near the root) faster than
  for bisection and convergence is guranteed. But for some functions, the convergence may also be 
  slower than bisection. The method is also known as "regula falsi". */
