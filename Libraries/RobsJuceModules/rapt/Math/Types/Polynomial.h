/** A class for representing polynomials and doing computations with them. Much of the code is 
implemented as static member functions that operate directly on arrays of the type T, so you don't
have to create an instance of class rsPolynomial to use its functionality. However, for 
convenience, you may also instantiate polynomial objects and then you can do arithemetic operations
with these objects directly, for example writing code like:

  rsPolynomial<double> r = p*q;

where p and q are both polynomials and so is r - and the * operator implements polynomial 
multiplication. But doing it this way is recommended mostly for prototyping only because creating
polynomials involves dynamic memory allocations. For production (especially real-time) code, it's 
better to operate on pre-allocated arrays with the static functions - this makes the code harder to 
read but more efficient.

There are some static functions that use their own template parameter types independent from the 
"T" that is used to instantiate the class. That's the case, for example, for functions that expect 
real inputs and produce complex outputs (like root-finders) which then use "R" for the real type
and std::complex<R> for the complex type. This is done because this class template should be able
to be instantiated for real and complex types "T", so using the same template parameter could lead
to confusion like the compiler using a nested complex type which makes no sense.
....under construction....tbc...  */

// todo: 
// -in the low-level function interfaces, use consistently "degree" or "aDeg", "bDeg" etc. 
//  instead of the generic N, aN, bN etc. to make it clear to the caller that the degree must be 
//  passed and *NOT* the length of the coefficient array (which is one more than the degree). 
//  Conflating the two is a constant source of confusion and off-by-one bugs and even heap 
//  corruptions.
// -use consistently input arrays as first and output arrays as last parameters for example in
//  interpolant, fitQuadraticDirect -> this will silenty break client code, so be extra careful to
//  adapt the code at *every* call site - it should be a consistent pattern through the library:
//  inputs first, then outputs...hmm - but that doesn't really work well when we want to have some
//  inputs optional - optional parameters must come last...hmmmm....maybe use:
//  required inputs, outputs, optional inputs - what about optional outputs? (for example, when we
//  fill an output-array only when a non-nullptr is passed?)...see what rsArrayTools does...
//  ...or maybe such an enforced consistency might not be a good idea, after all?
// -implement greatest common divisor algorithm (maybe the one for the integers can be
//  used as is?)
// -implement missing operators:
//  -operator() that takes a polynomial and returns another polynomial as result (implements 
//   nesting)
//  -arithmetic operators that take a number as second (left or right) argument
//  -maybe we could meaningfully define <,<=, ...? look at how python or other scientific libraries
//   handle that - in my own python polynomial class, i'm taking the asymptotic behavior
