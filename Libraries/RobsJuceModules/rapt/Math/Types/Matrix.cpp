ToDo:

Implement a class to represent triangular matrices which may be used with minor modifictions for
symmetric matrices, too: just instead of returning 0 when j > i, return A(j,i). Maybe antisymmetric 
matrices can also be represented by a minor modificiation: we need a way to remove the diagonal.
maybe when the user requests a size MxN matrix, we internally use a triangular array of size 
(M-1)x(N-1) or something. Of course, the formula to compute the flat index also needs modification.

Maybe experiment with things like that:
