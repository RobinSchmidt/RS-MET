/** This class determines the locations of poles and zeros in the s-plane for a continuous time, 
unit cutoff lowpass or low-shelving prototype filter. It supports Butterworth, Chebychev, inverse 
Chebychev, elliptic, Bessel and Papoulis designs. The low-shelving design is a generalization of a 
unit cutoff lowpass filter and and its magnitude response can be seen as the lowpass-response 
raised to a pedestal. The height of this pedestal is called the reference gain (which is zero in 
the lowpass-case). The gain the 'passband' (represented by the member variable G) is either a 
boost (when G > 1) or an attenuation/cut (when G < 1) - for standard lowpass designs, this gain 
would be unity.

\todo
 -test the gaussian design (compare poles with reference design, like Paarmann's GAUSSDE.m)
 -check the gain calculation, include gain factor
 -solve the degree quation for other values than the filter order
 -check getFilterResponseAt() - seems to be buggy - obsolete?
 -get rid of needsSpecialHighShelvTransform() - rewrite the prototype design code in such a way 
  that all approximations can be treated uniformly later on
 -lot's of stinky code duplication -> eliminate it */
