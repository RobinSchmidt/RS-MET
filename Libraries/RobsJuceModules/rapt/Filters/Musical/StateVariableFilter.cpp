  // -Figure out why we need the factor -1 for the cB coeff with respect to the formula 16d in the 
  //  paper. Different conventions?
  // -Try to avoid complex numbers: I think, if one of the values under the sqrt gets negative, the
  //  other one must be negative, too and at the end of the day, this just results in a sign-flip
  //  in some intermediate variable. Maybe keep the original formulas in a comment for reference.
  //  But maybe one being positive and the other negative could occur for unstable filters and 
  //  maybe we want to be able to match them, too? Sometimes, they are useful. It's rare but it 
  //  happens so we'd better be prepared for it. ...OK yes - in one of the unit tests, we actually
  //  have such a case. Adding an rsAssert(u1*u2 >= 0) would trigger in this unit test. ...hmm - 
  //  but in that case p = 0  ->  s = inf, so that's not really an unstable filter but some even
  //  more drastic error condition - so maybe we can indeed assume that either u1,u2 are both 
  //  positive or both negative? Figure that out!
}
// Maybe factor out into a static function - or maybe move the conversion into 
// rsFilterCoefficientConverter.

/*

ToDo:

-Implement a getTransferFunctionAt(Complex z) function with the same API as corresponding functions
 in the Ladder and Biquad filters

-Implement formulas from at this paper (done)
 http://www.dafx14.fau.de/papers/dafx14_aaron_wishnick_time_varying_filters_for_.pdf
 -> it has simpler formulas and even formulas that work for biquads with arbitrary coefficients
 -> make a function setupFromBiquad in the same way as in rsStateVectorFilter

-When done, maybe use these formulas for the biquad design:
 https://www.vicanek.de/articles/BiquadFits.pdf
 OK - the formulas have been implemented in biquadDesignVicanek in FilterExperiments.cpp. But maybe 
 actually using those to first compute biquad coeffs and then convert from biquad to svf coeffs is 
 unnecessarily expensive. Try to replicate Martin's approach using an expression for the SVF 
 magnitude response directly. I think, the R2 and g variables can be computed from Q and w0 and it 
 should be quite easy to derive the expressions. It then remains to derive expressions for cH, cB, 
 cL which may be a bit more involved - we'll see....

-Maybe have a look at this, too:
 https://zrna.org/akso/object/contrib/tiar/filter/ZDF-SVF-1
 The coefficient computation seems to start from a UDF design (Chamberlin) and then (Newton?) 
 iterate to refine for the ZDF case? Figure out!

-This paper approaches the same filter from a circuit-modeling perspective:
 https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.pdf
