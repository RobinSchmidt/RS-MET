This is the place for experimental prototype code and code that is currently under construction
and not yet production ready. When it reaches a reasonable level of maturity, it may be dragged 
over into the library. Thereby it must possibly be adapted (templatized, optimized, etc.). In 
some cases, the prototype can be kept here for reference, testing and education, too.
