  // Compares two matrix addressing schemes: using a flat array with pointer arithmetic vs. using
  // an pointer-to-pointer array. The test is to copy matrix values from one matrix into another.

  int N = 500;    // number of rows
  int M = 700;    // number of columns
  int i, j;       // row and column indices

  // allocate flat matrices and row-pointers, fill a-matrix with random values:
  float *af = new float[N*M];   // a1 matrix as flat array
  float *bf = new float[N*M];
  float **a = new float*[N];    // a1 row pointers
  float **b = new float*[N];
  for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
    a[i] = &af[i*M];
    b[i] = &bf[i*M];
  }
  ArrayTools::rsFillWithRandomValues(af, N*M, -1.f, +1.f, 0);

  // measure copying a into b via pointer-to-pointer access:
  ProcessorCycleCounter counter;
  counter.init();
  for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
    for(j = 0; j < M; j++)
      b[i][j] = a[i][j];
  }
  double cycles = (double) counter.getNumCyclesSinceInit();
  printPerformanceTestResult("pointer-to-pointer Matrix", cycles / (N*M));

  // measure copying a into b via pointer arithmetic:
  counter.init();
  for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
    for(j = 0; j < M; j++)
      bf[M*i+j] = af[M*i+j];
  }
  cycles = (double) counter.getNumCyclesSinceInit();
  printPerformanceTestResult("pointer-arithmetic Matrix", cycles / (N*M));

  // Results - cycles per element-access (in release build):
  // matrix size:            5x7 20x70  70x20  30x50  50x70  300x500
  // pointer-to-pointer:     20  11     10     9.1    12     22
  // pointer-arithmetic:     12   2      2     2.3    3.4    14

  // Conclusion:
  // Accessing matrix elements via pointer arithmetic is faster than using a pointer array 
  // (i.e. pointer-to-pointer). Add to that, that the pointer array needs additional storage
  // space - the relative increase in storage-size is given by 
  // sizeof(size_t) / (N*sizeof(ElementType)) - the conclusion is that using pointer arithmetic
  // is better - both, in terms of speed and storage space. The advantages seem greatest for
  // medium sized matrices (a couple of thousands of elements), but even for smaller and larger
  // matrices, pointer arithmetic beats pointer arrays.

  //delete[] af, bf, a, b; // nope - gives memory leak - we need to delete them all separately
  delete[] af;
  delete[] bf;
  delete[] a;
  delete[] b;
