// value, pointer or reference, if constness makes a difference, if using output parameters makes a

// compiled in Release mode (which is the relevant mode here)

// 3 variations of a class has 4 arrays of double as data members. They have wildy different memory
// footprints. The naive implementation FourArrays1 has hust 4 members of type std::vector. This 
// has a memory footprint of 128 byte. The variant FourAttays2 stores the length just once and no
// capacity and thereby saves quite a lot of memory. It uses 40 bytes. Finally FourArrays3 has just
// one pointer and implements the 4 arrays as parts of that allocated memory block. It has the 
// additonal potential advantage that the 4 arrays are guaranteed to be in successive memory
// blocks. And the best: the size would not grow further, if we would need more than 4 arrays.
// Debugging-wise, the std::vector based version is most convenient but when memory should be saved
// then one might opt for variant 3. This could be a good strategy for rsBiquadCascade. It has 
// these a, b, x, y arrays. We could make the objects a lot smaller by that strategy. And biquad 
// cascades are very important and can be used in all sorts of places, so optimizing their memory
// footprint might be a good idea.

  int sizeV = sizeof(std::vector<double>);  // 32

  int size2 = sizeof(FourArrays2);          // 40  = 4*8  + 8
  int size3 = sizeof(FourArrays3);          // 16  = 1*8  + 8, will not grow with number of arrays
  // Clearly, std::vector loses by a big margin. On the plus side, the implmentation will be easier
  // to read and debug. Generally, a vector/array needs to store: pointer,size,capacity or 
  // start,end,capacity. But that would be 3 bytes, but it apparently has 4 so it must store a 
  // fourth value. In the standard library of Visual Studio,  std::vector seems to have a data 
  // member of tye _Complressed_pair:
  //
  //   _Compressed_pair<_Alty, _Scary_val> _Mypair;
  //
  // and I have no idea what that is and why one would implement a vector liek that. I guess, the
  // code is generated. It certainly doesn't look like it was written with readability in mind.
