This project is my testsuite, laboratory and playground. It contains unit 
tests, performance tests, unoptimized prototype implementations, experiments 
where test data is thrown at the algorithms and results are plotted and/or 
written to wave-files, and also just some fun ideas to noodle around with. 
Clients normally don't need to deal with this stuff, that's why the code
here is even messier than in the actual libraries.
