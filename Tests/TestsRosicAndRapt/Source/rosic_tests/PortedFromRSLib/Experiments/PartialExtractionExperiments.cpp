idea for analysis algorithm for modal modeling:
-(maybe) pre-process by seprating excitation from resonator via linear prediction
-take a big chunk from the sample and FFT it (maybe N = 65536) with suitable window, possibly, the
 window should be only one-sided (right) to preserve information in the transient
-find spectral peaks:
 -estimate their frequencies and amplitudes by quadratic interpolation on dB values
 -maybe sort them according to ascending frequency (peak picking will probably sort with descending 
  magnitudes - but that might not be so bad either)
 -remember the globally maximal magnitude: mMax
-isolate and analyze one mode at a time:
 -apply a partial isolation filter for the given mode frequency (see below for details on this 
  filter)
 -refine the estimated mode frequency fM by counting periods (upward zero crossings) of the 
  filtered signal and divide by the time-interval
  -the first and last zero crossings should be determined with subsample precision via cubic 
   interpolation to get a more accurate (noninteger) time-interval
 -since our mode isolation filter may have nonunity gain at fM due to passband ripple, compute 
  the actual gain at fM and multiply signal with reciprocal to ensure unity gain
 -apply 1st order allpass with 90° frequency adjusted to fM to obtain a quadrature signal
  (maybe in reverse -> experiment, if this gives an advantage)
 -extract the instantaneous envelope as sqrt(y*y + q*q) where y is the isolated mode and q is the
  quadrature component
 -optionally smooth the instantaneous envelope with a 1st order bi-directional lowpass adjusted to
  a cutoff frequency of fM/s, where s is some smoothing parameter, maybe s = 4
 -to this extracted instantaneous mode envelope, we fit our model envelope (least-squares fit of
  a (constrained) sum of exponentials)
 -the phase of the mode can be obtained by looking at the first zero-crossing (or at some other
  zero crossing later)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Partial Isolation Filter

The main challenge for this filter is to isolate one partial in the frequency domain without 
smearing its amplitude envelope too much in the time domain. Filters with very high Q and/or great 
steepness will be able to isolate the partial better in the frequency domain at the expense of 
introducing more time smearing due to longer ringing. In order to preserve the phase of the 
partial, the filter should be applied bi-directionally (...which should have the side-effect of 
symmetrizing the time-smearing of the partial's amplitude envelope (?) - but this is not really 
what is observed - but maybe this is because the envelope itslef is asymmetrical)

The filter may be applied multiple times. With biquad bandpass filters, it has been found that the
time-smearing can be reduced by using multiple passes with lower Q instead of a single pass with 
high Q.

Maybe the time smearing (shifting of the envelope peak to the right) can be explained in terms of
group delay - but this should be zero in the bidirectional case (or not?). Or - more plausibly - 
the shifting of the peak can be related to the asymmetry of the input signal's envelope. Perhaps 
its useful to consider the convolution of an asymmetric signal like our the enveloped partial with 
our symmetric, zero-centered impulse response of the bidirectional filter. It's intuitive that the 
output is again asymmetric, skewed to where the input signal has more "weight", which in our case 
is the right side.

Idea for elliptic partial isolation filter
 -design an elliptic bandpass filter with its lower cutoff between the mode frequency fM and its 
  left neighbour and upper cutoff between fM and the right neighbour
  -the desired stopband rejection should be chosen such as to suppress all other modes to a certain 
   amount (like 40dB maybe), we need to take into account ratio of the mode amplitude mM and the 
   global maximum mMax
  -we may tolerate some passpand ripple too, since we will compensate for nonunity gain at the 
   mode frequency later
  -the exact cutoff points and the transition width should be chosen such that the neighbouring 
   modes are already in the stopband, ideally we would want to start the stopbands at the 
   neighbouring partials -> see, if elliptic filters can eb designed in terms of their stopband
   frequencies
  -maybe halfway between the frequencies could be used as cutoff points which may be defined as 
   arithmetic or geometric mean - expermient
  -there's a tradeoff to be made between the filter's ability to isolate the mode in the frequency 
   domain and the filters impulse response length - steeper filters will ring longer and therefore
   smear the isolated mode's envelope in the time domain - therefore, choose reasonable stopband
   rejections - experimentation required
 -filter the signal with the obtained mode-isolation filter bi-directionally (to preserve phase)
  -the bi-directional filtering will square the magnitude response of the filter - that should be
   taken into account in the design step before
 -more ideally, we would like to design the elliptic filter in terms of its 2 stopband frequencies 
  which should be taken as lower and upper neighbour mode frequencies, the transtion witdh should
  ensure that fM falls into the passband (with some margin because we don't know the frequency 
  exactly, so we need an error tolerance)


Experiments:

partialExtractionBell():
I tried to run a complex-phasor based implementation of a two-pole one-zero resonator over the 
signal to directly get the instantaneous envelope as the radius of the phasor - this was not very 
promising.

partialExtractionTriple():
To assess the performance of the partial isolation filter, we create a signal containing 3 
frequencies (for example: fL=900, fM=1000, fU=1150 Hz) all with unit amplitude and some kind 
attack/decay envelope and try to recover the partial at the middle frequency. To make it difficult 
for the filter, the middle partial should have a short attack time. We then look at the isolated 
partial's envelope to see how well the peak of the measured envelope matches the actual envelope of 
the partial. Typically, the attack will be smeared in the sense that the peak's location is 
right-shifted and its height is decreased. The smaller this effect, the better.

partialExtractionSample():
Feeds some real-world samples into the partial extraction filter and plots the resulting extracted
partial along with its amplitude envelope.


To assess the performance when dealing with a real world signal, we may do time-domain subtraction
of the isolated partial from the whole sound and see how much the partial gets reduced in the 
spectrum and how little the other partial are affected. Because the transient is important for us,
we should use either a one-sided (right-sided) window or no window at all for the FFT.



Experimental results:

partialExtractionTriple():

The measured envelope generally shows two kinds of artifacts compared to the true envelope: 
(1) time-shifting of the peak to the right (with resulting lowered peak height - the height is 
given by the partial's actual amplitude there) and (2) modulation at the difference frequencies 
fM-fL and fU-fM [check this]

Biquad bandpass
-multi-pass, low-Q filters smear envelope less compared to single-pass high-Q filter
 -the multi-pass application leads to a repeated convolution of the filter's impulse response with
  itself, such that the amplitude envelope of the impulse response approaches a Gaussian shape 
  [verify this]. The Gaussian shape has the minimum product of time-width and frequency-width and
  might be optimal therefore and rather independent from the filter design method [verify this].
  The more passes we run, the less filter-Q do we need in order to obtain a specified supression
  of other partials - which is kinda trivial. However, running more passes with lower-Q (adjusted 
  such that the supression in dB of a neighbour partial is always the same, say -50dB), has the
  effect of contracting the impulse response to a narrower time interval. the neighbour partial
  supression seems a relevant parameter since it determines how much our measured envelope will be
  contaminated by modulation artifacts.
-zero-padding the signal before multi-pass, bi-directional filtering (to take into account the 
 filter's ringing, avoiding edge effects) leads to small improvement for the envelope's peak 
 location (in the test with the partial-triple at 1kHz, improvement was around 10%)
-using unidirectional instead of bidirectional filtering just seems to shift the whole signal left
 (in case of backward running) or right (in case of forward running) but does not really seem
 to help to locate the peak more exactly
-in order to get an envelope that is not contaminated too much with modulation artifacts from other
 partials, it seems to be necessarry to supress all other partials to a level at least -50dB below 
 the partial under investigation. we should probably not supress them much further because that 
 would sacrifice too much time-resolution (the steeper, the more smear)


Experiments to do:
-instead of prepending zeros, try to prepend a reversed (and possibly negated) copy of the signal 
 to put more "weight" to the left side
-for the lowest mode, it might not be the best choice to pass 0 as lower partial neighbour 
 frequency - investigate that with the piano_E2 sample, or create an example sound
-investigate, if a deterministic function can be found that maps the real peak location/height
 to the measured values - this function depends on the number of passes and the filter shape, but 
 once we have settled for a particular filter, we can measure this function and apply its inverse
 to our peak measurements, it may also depend on the decay time of the partial -> investigate
 ->the actual height might possibly be found by extrapolating the decay-envelope to the actual 
   location
-try Butterworth/Papoulis/Elliptic/... bandpasses with lower and upper cutoff adjusted somewhere 
 between lower (or upper) neighbour partial and the middle partial to be isolated (maybe a weighted
 geometric mean could be used)
 -check, how increasing the order behaves compared to increasing the number of passes
-try a combination of elliptic filtering for supressing direct neighbours and Butterworth or 
 Papoulis filtering for supressing more distant partials
-try a combination of bandpass filtering with notch-filtering at other prominent partials
-maybe for each extracted partial, we could do time-domain subtraction before extracting the next
 partial. this may ease the work of subsequent filter. disadvantage: we can't extract just one
 partial indpendently from the others (but that might not matter much)



Extensions for Future Work:

To extract partials with time-varying frequency (assuming its instantaneous frequency to be known
at all samples) we need a time-varying filter, that tracks the instantaneous frequency. Now, time 
variation of a filter's parameters may introduce artifacts, the nature of which depends on the 
implementation structure of the filter. It is desirable to have some idea about what these 
artifacts are. Maybe a filter based on a spiraling complex phasor might be best suited for time 
variation: when we change the frequency, it will just continue to rotate with the new angular 
increment and when we change the damping, it will just continue to rotate but with a different
multiplier for the radius. ...but maybe somehow we have to account for phase response.

We need to find out, if this zero-phase property of bi-directional filtering does (in some sense) 
continue to hold for our time-varying filter.

To investigate behavior under time-variation, we could feed an impulse and at some point within
the filter's impulse response, change a parameter. If we change the damping, we should just see 
that the exponential envelope continues with a different time-constant. If we change the frequency,
we should just see that change in frequency. If we change the (start)phase, we should see a 
discontinuity in the waveform, reflecting a phase jump.

Experiments to do:
-tune filter to 1000Hz with a decay time-constant of 0.2s, feed an impulse
 (1) at 0.2s, change the decay to 0.1s
 (2) at 0.2s, change the decay to 0.4s
 (3) at 0.2s, change the frequency to 500Hz
 (3) at 0.2s, change the frequency to 2000Hz
 -look, if we see what we want to see
 -repeat these experiments with feeding sines of 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz
 -maybe investigate what a change of the phase does


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amplitude Envelope Extraction

Having isolated a partial with frequency fM, we estimate its amplitude envelope by obtaining a 90°
phase-shifted ("quadrature") version of it by allpass filtering and then use sqrt(x*x+q*q) as 
instantaneous envelope where x is the partial signal and q is the quadrature component. 


Experiments to do:
-try to apply the allpass in reverse direction, see if this makes a difference
-

Resynthesis:

-we may decide to neglect modes if they are determined to be inaudible because of masking effects

  // bw = 10: the partial is cleanly separated, but the envelope envelope is smeared very much

  // generally, maybe it's best to use bandwidths of k * df with k = 0.5...0.8 and df: distance
  // to closest neighbour partial in Hz

  // ideas for improving the envelope mesurement: 
  // the "smoothing" filter that is applied to the envelope could have notches at the modulation 
  // frequencies. more generally, we could perform frequency analysis on the envelope and determine 
  // modulation frequencies and place notches according to the analysis

  // when modulation is present in the envelope, we might want to choose the first local peak 
  // instead of the global one - maybe depending on the amplitude difference between first and 
  // highest - if the difference is small, choose the earlier. this effect is exemplified  with an 
  // attack of 0.025s - the global maximum is found at 0.029 but there's a local maximum at 0.21 
  // before - hmm - actually there's a local minimum at 0.025. maybe we should choose a higher Q

  // maybe, we should isolate the mode first by bi-directional bandpass filtering, maybe applied

  // after which increasing the number of passes further (and reducing p further) does not give

  // observations:
  // when the mode is not seperated cleanly in the frequency domain because of too little
  // filter steepness, we see modulations in the envelope with frequencies fM-fL and fU-fM (check
  // the frequencies) - this suggests that the "smoothing" filter that is applied to the envelope
  // should have notches there. more generally, we could perfom frequency analysis on the envelope
  // and determine modulation frequencies and place notches according to the analysis

  // when modulation is present in the envelope, we might want to choose the first local peak 
  // instead of the global one - maybe depending on the amplitude difference between first and 
  // highest - if the difference is small, choose the earlier. this effect is exemplified  with an 
  // attack of 0.025s - the global maximum is found at 0.029 but there's a local maximum at 0.21 
  // before - hmm - actually there's a local minimum at 0.025. maybe we should choose a higher Q 
  // and/or greater smoothing to get rid of the modulation entirely

  // observation: the envelope of the 1st mode looks more like having a fast early decay and slower
  // late decay - might be modeled by adding 3 exponentials, 1 for late decay, 1 for early decay 
  // and one for attack, like ae*exp(-t/te) + al*exp(-t/tl) - (ae+al)*exp(-t/ta), 
  // where te: tau early, tl: tau late, ta: tau attack, we should have tl > te > ta
  // parallel connection of 3 instead of 2 filters

  // when exited with the rubber, the 1st mode reaches its maximum after 0.012s whereas when 
  // excited with the teaspoon, the maximum is reached after 0.017s - so a soft exictation lead to 
  // faster buildup of a low-frequency mode - maybe in an hard excitation, higher modes are excited 
  // first and over time energy is transfered into the lower modes via nonlinear effects?
