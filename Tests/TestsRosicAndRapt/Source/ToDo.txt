-figure out, why rsSinusoidalAnalyzer may produce negative values for the amplitude of the DC 
 component (and fix it)
-check, how the synthesis handles DC - i guess it creates just a cosine of 0 frequency? if so, we 
 should perhaps encode a negative DC by using a phase of pi
-check rsFourierTransformerRadix2<T>::getRealSignalMagnitudesAndPhases - there seems to be a bug
