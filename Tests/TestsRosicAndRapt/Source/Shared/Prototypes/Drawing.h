/** Fills all pixels whose centers are inside the given triangle with the given color. If a pixel
center is on an edge, it will be considered inside, if it's a top or a left edge 
("top-left rule"). It corresponds to a convention where a pixel with coordinate i (i being the 
integer x or y coordinate) being defined as covering the range [i, i+1), i.e. an interval that 
is closed to the left and open to ther right, i.e. including i but excluding i+1.
The order of the vertices doesn't matter.
A top edge, is an edge that is exactly horizontal and is above the other edges.
A left edge, is an edge that is not exactly horizontal and is on the left side of the triangle. 
A triangle can have one or two left edges.
