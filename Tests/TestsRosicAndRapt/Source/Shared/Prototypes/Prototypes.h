/** A class for representing a particular kind of string with which we can do some computations 
just like with numbers. The set of all such strings forms a group (see group theory). The group 
operation (which we call addition here) is to concatenate two strings and then delete all pairs of
equal characters, i.e. the string "aaab" would be reduced to "ab", one "aa" pair is deleted. The 
inverse element to each string is obtained by reversing it. Adding "cba" to "abc" like abc+cba 
results in abccba wich would subsequently be reduced to the empty string (the rule of deleting 
equal pairs is used as often as applicable). The additive neutral element is the empty string. */
