-release the library as GPL

-give out individual closed source licenses on a case-by-case basis, with the 
 following policy:
 
 -for individuals, closed source licenses and non-GPL open source licenses are
  possible by individual negotiation
  
 -for companies, sell licenses that apply to a particular version of the 
  library and a particular product of the respective company
  -for using updated versions of the library, an update fee may be charged
  -for using the library in another product, another license is required
  -price depends on the size of the company and product - rough orientation:
   for small-scale products, it may be a 3-figure number, for large scale 
   companies/products, a 4-figure number
  -rationale: 
   -i, as licensor, am most interested in creating a steady revenue 
    stream in the long run - from my perspective, a subscription based 
	licensing model would be preferable
   -the licensee is interested in being able to use the code indefinitely into
    the future, independently from any such subscription costs - they would 
	presumably prefer a (possibly rather high) one-time fee that applies to 
	all of their present and future products and to all future versions of the
	library
   -the scheme above gives a compromise between both interests that should be
    acceptable for both sides
  -update costs will depend on the version difference and will possibly take
   into account, if a company/product has grown larger since purchase of the 
   initial license (or previous update)
   
 -clients usually get an appropriate license included, provided that they 
  already pay reasonably for work hours (i.e. a certain minium number of 
  work-hours are purchased)
