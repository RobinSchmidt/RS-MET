points to make:
-different constructions/curves with equal looking shapes (order of traversal matters)

Fractal Synthesis Language
--------------------------
 
To build a musical sound synthesis algorithms from the concepts above
 
### Extensions to Turtle Syntax
 
 
### Extensions to Lindenmayer Syntax
  
  
Fractal Pattern Synthesis
-------------------------
 
 
### Curve Traversal
 
##### Cyclic Resets (or not)
 
 
##### Loop Modes
 
Turning Angle Modulation ...maybe allow Step Size Modulation, too?
 
  4.3: Normalization Modes
  4.5: Subtractive Post Processing
   4.5.1 Regular Musical Filters
   4.5.2 Linear Phase Filters
  4.6: Rational Numbers and Harmonics
   4.5.2 Number of Segments (N) vs Segment Length (L)

Sound Design Guide:
-if you want the free-running behavior to match the reset-mode, you need to make sure that the
 turtle heads into the same direction as initially after it completed a cycle around the seed, i.e,
 for a square seed (at 90°) don't use F+F+F+F but F+F+F+F+, the additionla plus at the end makes 
 the turtle look to the right again after completing the square
-an turn angle sligtly off from the ideal value lets the picture slowly rotate in free-running mode
-rules with branches create nice overtone structures (branches introduce discontinuities in the 
 waveshape)
-to analyze a patch:
 -stop rotation (if any) by setting turning angle to precise value and/or use resetting
 -turn the numIterations to zero to see the seed
 -turn it to 1 to see the rule, maybe use a simple 'F' seed to see the pure rule
