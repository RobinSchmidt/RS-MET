A (N/M) Pade approximant to a function is constructed by equating a rational function with 
numerator degree N and denominator degree M to a Taylor approximant of degree N+M. Let's consider 
an example with N=2, M=3. We have:

   a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2
  ----------------------------- = c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + c3*x^3 + c4*x^4 + c5*x^5
   b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2 + b3*x^3

where we assume the c_i to be known and we want to figure out the a_i and b_i. Without loss of 
generality, we may assume b0 = 1 but for making the patterns more apparent, we'll write out b0. The 
next thing to do is to multiply the rhs by the numerator:
  
  a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 = (b0+b1*x+b2*x^2+b3*x^3) * (c0+c1*x+c2*x^2+c3*x^3+c4*x^4+c5*x^5)
                     = x^0 * (b0*c0) +
                       x^1 * (b0*c1 + b1*c0) +
                       x^2 * (b0*c2 + b1*c1 + b2*c0)
                       x^3 * (b0*c3 + b1*c2 + b2*c1 + b3*c0) + 
                       x^4 * (b0*c4 + b1*c3 + b2*c2 + b3*c1 + b4*c0) + 
                       x^5 * (b0*c5 + b1*c4 + b2*c3 + b3*c2 + b4*c1 + b5*c0)

Now we need to equate the coefficients for like powers of x on the lhs and rhs. We actually already 
know that b4 = b5 = 0. We also observe that the lhs has no terms with a power of 3 or higher, so 
their a-coeffs are zero. So let's first look at the coeffs for x^3,x^4,x^5. We need to have:

  x^3: 0 = b0*c3 + b1*c2 + b2*c1 + b3*c0
  x^4: 0 = b0*c4 + b1*c3 + b2*c2 + b3*c1
  x^5: 0 = b0*c5 + b1*c4 + b2*c3 + b3*c2

Now we use b0 = 1 to get the 3x3 matrix equation:

  |c2 c1 c0|   |b1|   |-c3|
  |c3 c2 c1| * |b2| = |-c4|
  |c4 c3 c2|   |b3|   |-c5|

which we can solve for b1,b2,b3. Having those in hand (together with b0 = 1), we now turn to the 
coeffs for x^0,x^1,x^2 to compute the nonzero a-coeffs. This is actually easy, because the 
remaining system is already triangular.

  x^0: a0 = b0*c0
  x^1: a1 = b0*c1 + b1*c0
  x^2: a2 = b0*c2 + b1*c1 + b2*c0

We already know everything on the rhs, so we can directly compute a0,a1,a2.

...i think, in general, we get an MxM linear system with an all-zeros rhs for the b-coeffs and once
they have been computed, we are left with a triangular (N+1)x(N+1) system for the a-coeffs where 
the b-coeffs appear on the rhs?

ToDo:
-Implement and test the algorithm on some well known Taylor series such as for exp. Compare 
 computed Pade approximants to what SageMath and wolfram alpha produce.
-Maybe implement also an inverse procedure that computes Taylor coeffs from Pade coeffs. Compare 
 this to the Taylor coeffs that result from actually carrying out the differentiations. Maybe the 
 resulting procedure is a better (more efficient and/or numerically accurate?) way to find Taylor
 series for rational functions?
