Given a 3D vector field defined by the 3 trivariate functions:

  f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z)

we want to find another vector field:

  F(x,y,z), G(x,y,z), H(x,y,z)

such that the curl of F,G,H equals f,g,h. The field F,G,H is called the vector 
potential of f,g,h. The necessarry and sufficient condition for such a vector 
potential to exist is that the divergence of f,g,h is zero. From the definition
of curl, we see that F,G,H must satisfy the 3 simultaneous equations:

  f = H_y - G_z, g = F_z - H_x, h = G_x - F_y

where H_y denotes the partial derivative of H with respect to y and so on 
(subscripts, symbolized by the underscore _, denote partial derivatives).
Vector potentials are not unique. We have some freedom of choice and we use it
to set H(x,y,z) = const which simplifies the equation system to:

  f = -G_z, g = F_z, h = G_x - F_y

The f,g equations lead to:

  G = -f^z + a(x,y), F = g^z + b(x,y)

where we use the superscript notation, subolized by the caret ^, to denote 
integration ("antidifferentiation") with respect to the superscripted 
variable, so f^z is f integrated with respect to z. With a(x,y), b(x,y), we
denote the integration "constants". They are constant only with respect 
to z but can still be functions of x and y. We can now compute the integrals 
f^z, g^z and are left with the task to figure out some appropriate integration
constants a = a(x,y), b = b(x,y) such that the third equation is satisfied:

  h = G_x - F_y 
    = (-f^z + a)_x - (g^z + b)_y 
    = (-f^z)_x + a_x - (g^z)_y + b_y
  
  h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y

This is one equation for the two unknown functions a_x, b_y. We have a 
again some freedom of choice and use it to set b_y = 0 which determines our
integration constants as:

  a_x = h + f^z_x + g^z_y
  b_y = 0

Integrating a_x with respect to x and b_y with respect to y gives our desired
functions:

  a = a(x,y) = a_x^x = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)^x
  b = b(x,y) = b_y^y = 0^y = c(x)

where c(x) can be function of x but for simplicity, we can also set it to zero.

wait: shouldn't a_x be a function of y,z and b_y a function of x,z only? Aren't
they supposed to be constant with respect to the subscripted variable such that
they vanish when being differentiated with respect to that variable? ...but 
further above, a and b are both supposed to be functions of x,y. Does that 
imply that a_x should depend only on y and b_y only on x? Hmmm - that's 
confusing. However, the code based on the derivation above seems to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other choices:

We may want the divergence of F,G,H to be zero. In this case, we have the 
additional equation:

  F_x + G_y + H_z = 0

hmm...if we keep using H = const, we would have H_z = 0, so F_x = - G_y, so:

  h = G_x - F_y = 2*G_x

we still need to satisfy:

  h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y

maybe with a more symmetric choice like:

  a_x = h/2 + f^z_x
  b_y = h/2 + g^z_y
  
or:

  a_x = h/2 + g^z_y
  b_y = h/2 + f^z_x

or:

  a_x = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)/2
  b_y = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)/2

we could get somewhere?

Creating a gradient field with a given divergence. The idea is to obtain the 
difference between a desired divergence and the divergence of the field 
created by the algo above and then add a gradient field to it that has the
difference-divergence. That way, we may create a vector potential with any 
desired divergence - often zero is a convenient choice

A gradient field must satisfy the Laplace equation. In addition to that, we 
require the divergence to be given by a specific function. So, we are looking 
for a vector field f,g,h that simultaneously satisfies:

  f_xx + g_yy + h_zz = 0            Laplace equation
  f_x  + g_y  + h_z  = d(x,y,z)     Divergence is specified by d(x,y,z)

Can we set h = 0? Let's try it:

  f_xx + g_yy = 0
  f_x  + g_y  = d
  
  f_x = d - g_y
  f   = (d - g_y)^x + a(y)
