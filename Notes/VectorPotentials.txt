Given a 3D vector field defined by the 3 trivariate functions:

  f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z)

we want to find another vector field:

  F(x,y,z), G(x,y,z), H(x,y,z)

such that the curl of F,G,H equals f,g,h. The field F,G,H is called the vector 
potential of f,g,h. The necessarry and sufficient condition for such a vector 
potential to exist is that the divergence of f,g,h is zero. From the definition
of curl, we see that F,G,H must satisfy the 3 simultaneous equations:

  f = H_y - G_z, g = F_z - H_x, h = G_x - F_y

where H_y denotes the partial derivative of H with respect to y and so on 
(subscripts, symbolized by the underscore _, denote partial derivatives).
Vector potentials are not unique. We have some freedom of choice and we use it
to set H(x,y,z) = const which simplifies the equation system to:

  f = -G_z, g = F_z, h = G_x - F_y

The f,g equations can now be simply integrated to give:

  G = -f^z + a(x,y), F = g^z + b(x,y)                      (1)

where we use the superscript notation, symbolized by the caret ^, to denote 
integration ("antidifferentiation") with respect to the superscripted 
variable, so f^z is f integrated with respect to z. With a(x,y), b(x,y), we
denote the integration "constants". They are constant only with respect 
to z but can still be functions of x and y. We can now compute the integrals 
f^z, g^z and are left with the task to figure out some appropriate integration
constants a = a(x,y), b = b(x,y) such that the third equation is satisfied:

  h = G_x - F_y 
    = (-f^z + a)_x - (g^z + b)_y 
    = (-f^z)_x + a_x - (g^z)_y + b_y
  
  h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y                            (2)

This is one equation for the two unknown functions a_x, b_y. We have a 
again some freedom of choice and use it to set b_y = 0 which determines our
integration constants as:

  a_x = h + f^z_x + g^z_y
  b_y = 0

Integrating a_x with respect to x and b_y with respect to y gives our desired
functions:

  a = a(x,y) = a_x^x = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)^x
  b = b(x,y) = b_y^y = 0^y = c(x)

where c(x) can be function of x but for simplicity, we can also set it to zero.

wait: shouldn't a_x be a function of y,z and b_y a function of x,z only? Aren't
they supposed to be constant with respect to the subscripted variable such that
they vanish when being differentiated with respect to that variable? ...but 
further above, a and b are both supposed to be functions of x,y. Does that 
imply that a_x should depend only on y and b_y only on x? Hmmm - that's 
confusing. However, the code based on the derivation above seems to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other choices:

We may want the divergence of F,G,H to be zero. In this case, we have the 
additional equation:

  F_x + G_y + H_z = 0

hmm...if we keep using H = const, we would have H_z = 0, so F_x = - G_y, so:

  h = G_x - F_y = 2*G_x  ...wait - what? why? mistake?

we still need to satisfy:

  h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y

maybe with a more symmetric choice like:

  a_x = h/2 + f^z_x
  b_y = h/2 + g^z_y
  
or:

  a_x = h/2 + g^z_y
  b_y = h/2 + f^z_x

or:

  a_x = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)/2
  b_y = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)/2

we could get somewhere? maybe require:

  F_x + G_y = d(x,y,z)           prescribe divergence as d (H_z assumed 0)

using our equations (1) for F,G: F = b + g^z, G = a - f^z

  d = (b + g^z)_x + (a - f^z)_y
    = a_y + b_x - f^z_y + g^z_x

we still have to satisfy (2), so we get the two equations:

  C := h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y
  D := d + f^z_y - g^z_x = a_y + b_x

set b_y = 0 as before, compute a_x, integrate to get a, compute a_y, compute
b_x = D - a_y, integrate to get b 

the code doesn't work: the divergence is indeed zero, but F,G,H seems not to 
be a vector potential anymore - some coeffs in the computed curl match f,g,h 
but others are totally wrong (it's not a precision issue) - i guess our 
integration constants a(x,y), b(x,y) do in fact depend on z? maybe we can't 
simply set b_y = 0 as before anymore. maybe we should write out the 2 
equations C = ..., D = ... in terms of all the coefficients involved, giving
 a large system of linear equations for all coeffs of a,b?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a gradient field with a given divergence. The idea is to obtain the 
difference between a desired divergence and the divergence of the field 
created by the algo above and then add a gradient field to it that has the
difference-divergence. That way, we may create a vector potential with any 
desired divergence - often zero is a convenient choice

A gradient field must satisfy the Laplace equation. In addition to that, we 
require the divergence to be given by a specific function. So, we are looking 
for a vector field f,g,h that simultaneously satisfies:

  f_xx + g_yy + h_zz = 0            Laplace equation
  f_x  + g_y  + h_z  = d(x,y,z)     Divergence is specified by d(x,y,z)

Can we set h = 0? Let's try it:

  f_xx + g_yy = 0
  f_x  + g_y  = d
  
  f_x = d - g_y
  f   = (d - g_y)^x + a(y)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's consider the 2D case first and let's be a bit more general by not 
setting the Laplacian to zero but to some arbitrary polynomial L(x,y) and call 
the divergence D(x,y). We have the two equations:

  f_x  + g_y  = D
  f_xx + g_yy = L

Let's denote the coefficients of the matrices for the bivariate polynomials 
f,g by a_ij, b_ij. Then, our two equations can be written in terms of the 
coeffcients as:

        i*a_ij +       j*b_ij = D_ij      i=1..M, j=1..N
  (i-1)*i*a_ij + (j-1)*j*b_ij = L_ij      i=2..M, j=2..N

where D_ij, L_ij are the polynomial coefficients of the divergence and 
Laplacian. Let's solve the first equation for b_ij:

  b_ij = (D_ij - i*a_ij) / j

and plug the result into the second:

  (i-1)*i*a_ij + (j-1)*(D_ij - i*a_ij) = L_ij

and solve for a_ij:

  (i-1)*i*a_ij + (j-1)*D_ij - (j-1)*(i*a_ij) = L_ij
  (i-1)*i*a_ij - (j-1)*i*a_ij = L_ij - (j-1)*D_ij
  ((i-1)-(j-1))*i * a_ij = L_ij - (j-1)*D_ij
  
  a_ij = (L_ij - (j-1)*D_ij) / (((i-1)-(j-1))*i)
  
That should be it - we can compute a_ij from the known D_ij and L_ij and once 
we have them, we can compute b_ij by the equation further above. -> Try it!
If it works, we can just set L_ij to all zeros, if we want a gradient field 
with a given divergence. This should hopefully work for the 3D case, too. We 
just have to use:

  a_ijk = (L_ijk - (j-1)*D_ijk) / (((i-1)-(j-1))*i)
  b_ijk = (D_ijk - i*a_ijk) / j

What about the division by zero when i = j for the a_ijk and when j = 0 for the 
b_ijk? How about defining a (2D) vector field not via divergence and Laplacian 
but by divergence and (2D) curl or curl and Laplacian? Maybe the function could 
be called divAndCurlToField, divAndLapToField, etc. Does this uniquely determine
all coeffs? the equations are only valid for certain ranges of indices - what 
about the other coeffs? can they be chosen freely?


...wait - no: f_xx + g_yy is not the Laplacian! The Laplacian is defined for a 
scalar field! We are actually looking for a scalar potential P(x,y) which 
satisfies:

  P_x  + P_y  = D
  P_xx + P_yy = L

in terms of coefficients, this means:

        i*P_ij +       j*P_ij = D_ij           i=1..M, j=1..N
  (i-1)*i*P_ij + (j-1)*j*P_ij = L_ij           i=2..M, j=2..N

no - this is still wrong. If we can find a scalar field with a given divergence, 
it's Laplacian it automatically zero - we have just one equation:

  i*P_ij + j*P_ij = D_ij           i=1..M, j=1..N

which we can easily solve for P_ij:

  P_ij = D_ij / (i + j)           i=1..M, j=1..N

no - still wrong: P_x and P_y is supposed to be our gradient field. To get 
its divergence, we must differentiate once more (and add the results), so:

  (i-1)*i*P_ij + (j-1)*j*P_ij = D_ij        i=2..M, j=2..N

so:

  P_ij = D_ij / (i*(i-1) + j*(j-1))         i=2..M, j=2..N

i think, for i,j < 2, we can freely choose whatever we want. To get the desired
vector field f,g we just take partial derivatives, i.e. the gradient of P
...still wrong: we need to shift indices:

  P_ij = D_{i-2,j-2} / (i*(i-1) + j*(j-1))         i=2..M, j=2..N

M = D.degX, N = D.degY

or like this?:

  (m-1)*m*P_{m+2,n} + (n-1)*n*P_{m,n+2} = D_mn        m=2..M, n=2..N
  
  choose P_{m+2,n} freely (for example, zero) and use:
  
  P_{m,n+2} = (D_mn - (m-1)*m*P_{m+2,n}) / ((n-1)*n)
