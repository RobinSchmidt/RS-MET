Goals:

-dynamically changing the type of module plugged into a particular slot
-arbitrary routing modulator outputs to any number of parameters, like
 with the modulation system in jura, but:
-everything should work polyphonically
-no formal distinction between modulation and audio generators
-no formal distinctions between sources and effects
-modules should be able to dynamically change ther I/O properties


Synth contains 3 sections:
-QuadSource: 4 sources with vector mixer
-DualFilter: 2 filters with routing setup
