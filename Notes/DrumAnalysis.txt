Estimate pitch envelope of drum sample:
-Smooth the sample suitably
-Measure zero crossings
-The smoothing should perhaps not be a regular lowpass. Maybe that would destroy important features.
 Maybe as alternative, we could use a wavelet transform, zero out higher coeffs (or taper them off) 
 and then transform back. Maybe Haar Trafo could be suitable.
-Maybe a time-varying zero-phase lopwass could also be good. The cutoff could be controlled by some 
 preliminary estimate of the freq envelope. Maybe that could be based on the time-varying spectral 
 centroid in the STFT. We could use an FIR implementation of a windowed-sinc lowpass with a Gaussian
 window. Maybe the coeffs could be computed on the fly recursively such that we don't need to 
 evaluate so many epxonentials. However - a first experimental prototype could just use the regular
 windowed sinc implementation
-Or maybe use a bidirectional brickwall somewhere above the max-pitch of the fundamental, then
-Upward zero crossings give only one datapoint per cycle, but we can increase the density by looking 
 also at the downward zero crossings and also at the minima and maxima. Maybe we could even use 
 higher order derivative information: Use zero crossings of derivatives up to some number n. The 
 derivatives could be obtained by central differences or maybe higher order methods.
