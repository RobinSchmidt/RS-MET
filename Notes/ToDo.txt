Create github projects for:
DSP, DAW, rosic, Plugin Framework, Documentation, Library organization
DSP: cols: synthesis, analysis, effects, modulation, 
 musical filters, technical filters, reverb (algo, convo), modulators, synthesis...maybe move
 snowflake as a card into there
Documentation: user manuals for ToolChain modules, pdf doc for rapt/rosic rendered by doxygen
Plugin Framework: parameters: modulation system, automation system

in the research repo, we could have projects for:
research papers, math book, tutorials ...maybe the latex source should go there




fix linker errors in win/gcc:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329020/undefined-reference-to-sync-val-compare-and-swap-4-error-at-compilation-usi
-maybe updating gcc will help...

now i get a compiler error: 'sscanf' was not declared in this scope
#include <cstdio> added to juce_win32_ComSamrtPtr.h
fixed it

now i get linker errors related to flac codec code - seems like whenever the 
codec calls fprintf, it doesn't find the stdin, stdout, stderr things?
from stdio.h:
#define stdin	(&_iob[STDIN_FILENO])
#define stdout	(&_iob[STDOUT_FILENO])
#define stderr	(&_iob[STDERR_FILENO])
it doesn't seem to find the iob thing - we may have tell the linker to link a 
library that constains these symbols




-drag over the remaining GUI widget classes

make JUCE leaner:

The binaries for the JUCE based products are really big. Maybe we can reduce the bloat in the 
following way:
-in Libraries/JUCE create a 2nd subfolder modules_lean (or modules_stripped or whatever)
-copy over the folder contents of the original modules folder
-in each module folder, delete the guts and edit the master module header file to refer
 the includes to the original mdoule folder (this might potentially be a problem since
 the guts are not inside the module folder itself - if it turns out to be a problem,
 don't delete them and don't change the references)
-now that we have our own copy of the module folder, we can in each module include 
 h/cpp file pair comment out everything we don't need, thus we have a finer granularity of control
 over what gets compiled into the binary compared to leaving out completet modules (which may
 be not possible when we need a subset of some module)
-in the Projucer projects, set up the module path accordingly to use the modules 
 from the modules_lean folder
-this should reduce reduce the binary size and compilation time
