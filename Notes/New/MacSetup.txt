This file is just for some quick and dirty notes about how get certain things to work on apple. 
This is sometimes a less than straightforward trial and error process, hence this file to note down 
what worked out.

How to fix "you do not have permission to open the application "Game app", another easy solution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWSySXfR17c

Open terminal (right-click on the Sampler folder, choose "New terminal at folder"), enter:

sudo spctl --master-disable 

go to: System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> click the lock -> enter password

Click on "Anywhere", in the terminal enter:

sudo chmod -R 755 ToolChain.app

restart computer

double click on the app and confirm to open it

todo: 
-Test, if the same problem occurs with AudioPluginHost, rationale: the new JUCE says that for 
 plugin projects, one should use the new cmake build system. So maybe the culprit is that I'm still
 using the Projucer. But that doesn't apply to standalone projects


After download Sampler.7z, this worked:

-copy archive to home folder
-uncompress (by double-click)
 ->trying to launch gives "no permission" error
-enter in terminal: codesign --force --deep --sign - ToolChain.app
 ->still the same error
-enter in terminal: sudo chmod -R 755 ToolChain.app
 ..and enter the password
 ->still the same error
-copy ToolChain.app to another folder, like [home]/temp
 ->it can now be launched from there
-copying it back into the original folder, replacing the original file
 ->it can now be launched from there, too
