typical properties of acoustic instruments:
-louder notes have 
 -more overtones (lowpass filter should track velocity) 
 -faster attack (attack time should track velocity)
 -longer decay (really?)
-higher notes have 
 -faster envelope (envelope timescale should track key)
 -less overtones (filter keytrack < 100%)
-formants are independent from note pitch (i.e. no filter keytrack)
-moving sound sources have doppler shifts
-in transients, the pitch may deviate from steady state (pitch envelope)
-generally, the sound goes from bright to dull over time
 ->filter envelope from high to low

desirable features:
-detuning (in semitones) between oscillators should become less for higher 
 notes
 -can be achieved by keytracking of detune (in st) and/or by using fixed 
  detuning in Hz
-higher notes should often be less loud (keytrack of master volume)
-patches should have the same loudness - maybe use loudness meter when 
 adjusting patches
-a stereo correlation between 0 and 0.5 ist mostly pleasant, maybe correlation
 should be higher in the low-freq range (use mid/side EQ)
 -use a correlation meter
 -use a scope in XY mode with 45° rotation such that pure mid-signals give 
  vertical lines and pure side signals horizontal lines
 -adjust mid/side ratio for a balance between width and height, maybe a bit
  more height than width (correlation a bit more than 0)
