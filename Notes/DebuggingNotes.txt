For the standalone version of ToolChain, the JUCE framework provides functionality to recall the 
last plugin state when the plugin is launched, i.e. on startup, it tries to restore the state from
when it was closed. The file where this persistent state data is stored is found (on my machines) 
in:

  Windows: C:\Users\rob\AppData\Roaming\ToolChain\ToolChain.settings
  macOS:   ToDo: figure out!
  Linux:   ToDo: figure out!

These folders and files are created and updated silently by the JUCE framework. I found the 
location(s) with the search function of windows explorer (searching for "ToolChain"). Sometimes, 
it's necessary to manually delete this file, for example when the app crashes on startup during the 
state recall. When the file is missing, the app will start in a "blank" state and the file will be 
re-created when closing the app.


I sometimes run into this problem when building ToolChain standalone and run it in the debugger:

ToDo: Figure out and document, how this problem can be solved! I can't tell for sure anymore, but if
I remember correctly, deleting the .settings file can also help with this. But that doesn't seem to 
make sense - what has MIDI to do with state-recall? ...but I may misremember this.
