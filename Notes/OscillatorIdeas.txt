-For an exactly reproducible pseudo-random start phase of the oscillator, we could use the midi 
 state. For example, some hash-function of the most recently received note values, maybe also taking 
 the velocities into account. Maybe we coul also use a function that maps velocities like
 (vel % k) * 360 for some k around 10 - maybe 11 or 13 or something. Rationale: the player cannot
 control the velocity that finely, so it is a random value with a variance +-5.
