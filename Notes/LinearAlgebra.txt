Nullspace:

computing the nullspace of an NxN matrix A works as follows:
-compute the row-echelon form of matrix A - let's call it B

-the number k of nonzero lines of B is called the rank
-the number of zero-lines N-k of B gives the dimensionality of the 
 nullspace
-to find a basis for the nullspace we may proceed as follows:

let's imagine, a 5x5 matrix B in row echelon form looks like this:

  1 2 3 4 5
  0 6 7 8 9
  0 0 1 2 3
  0 0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0

We have 2 zero rows, so the dimensionality of the nullspace is 2 and 
the rank of b is 3. To find a basis for the nullspace, we must solve the 
linear system B * x = 0 - but this system has infinitely many solutions. To 
find them, we must solve a 3x3 system 2 times, for two different right-hand 
sides. We obtain the coefficient matrix for this 3x3 system and the 
corresponding right hand sides as follows - write B * x = 0 as:

  1 2 3 4 5   x1   0
  0 6 7 8 9   x2   0
  0 0 1 2 3 * x3 = 0
  0 0 0 0 0   x4   0
  0 0 0 0 0   x5   0
  
Because the last two rows are all zeros, it doesn't matter what we choose for 
x4 and x5 - we may treat them as our free parameters. We choose 2 different
assignments, like x4=1, x5=0 and x4=0, x5=1 (in general, in each assignment 
we choose all values to be zero except one, which we set to 1 - we set each of
our free parameters to in turn). so this gives two systems:

  1 2 3 4 5   x1 x1 = 0 0
  0 6 7 8 9   x2 x2 = 0 0
  0 0 1 2 3 * x3 x3 = 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0    1  0 = 0 0
  0 0 0 0 0    0  1 = 0 0
  
we rewrite this as:

  1 2 3   x1 x1    0  0
  0 6 7 * x2 x2 = -4  0
  0 0 1   x3 x3    0 -9

These are two 3x3 linear systems which are already in triangular form, so we 
just need to throw the backsubstitution algo at it






Eigenvalues:


Eigenspace:

The eigenspace of a matrix A to an eigenvalue x_i is the nullspace of the 
matrix A - x_i * I where I is the identity matrix. For each eigenvalue x_i, 
the dimensionality of the eigenspace is called the geometric multiplicity of 
x_i and this is less or equal to its algebraic multiplicity. The vectors that 
span the eigenspace of x_i are called the
