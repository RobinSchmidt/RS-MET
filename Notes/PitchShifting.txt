My Ideas

- The method of LD could perhpas be modified by not translating the peaks along the frequency axis
  but rather by zeroing them out (with a smooth notchy gain function ceneterd at the peak), then 
  resynthesizing the block without the peaks and then adding the missing sinuosidal peaks using an 
  oscillator bank (all before applying the synthesis window). 
  - The rationale is that this peak translation business may introduce artifacts due to the fact 
    that we only translate the main lobe and not the whole freq response of the peak. The osc bank 
	would synthesize a perfect sinusoid at the new desired frequency. 
  - It could also solve the problem of modulation artifacts when the new frequency ends up halfway
    between bins and will therefore be spread over two new bins (assuming linear interpolation).
  - To obtain more exact peak locations, we could run a second FFT using a 
    Gaussian window. This second FFT is used only for analysis. The modifications and resynthesis 
	will be done with a perfect overlap window such as Hann.
  
- The method presented in JH could potentially be improved by not using rounding but rather by 
  interpolating the complex spectrum. Maybe linear or polynomial interpolation could be suitable.
  
- The method in LSM could perhaps be improved by using elliptic filters (the paper actually mentions 
  this).

- We could use complex ellpitic bandpasses and use their output to make estimations of instantaneous
  amplitude and phase of the current band. We could use this information to do a modified 
  resynthesis with an oscillator bank. We could integrate the instantaneous phase to obtain 
  instantaneous frequency, modify that, differentiate and use the resulting new instantaneous phase.
  We could perhaps also use the class SingleSineModeler. Maybe we could also use a perfect 
  reconstruction FIR filter bank.
