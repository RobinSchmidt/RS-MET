We consider a filter that creates its impulse response as the difference of two exponential decay
filters, one with a slower decay and one withe the faster - the fast decaying exponential is 
subtracted from the slowly decaying exponential to get a smooth attack/decay shape for an envelope
generator. The expressions for the impulse responses are

  dn := d[n] = d0 * cd^n      decay
  an := a[n] = a0 * ca^n      attack
  en := e[n] = s*(dn-an)      envelope
  
where d0,a0 are the initial states that we assume to be given as
  
  d0 = x + ya
  a0 = x + yd
  
we assume x to be an input impulse and we assume that the filter's remembered state variables
d[n-1], a[n-1] are stored in yd,ya respectively. We want to figure out, how high the impulse x 
must be, so as to reach a peak value of 1, regardless of what the internal state yd,ya is. That is,
we want to find a suitable way to scale ot modify the input impulses to avoid accumulation of 
peak-heights when the enevlope generator receives multiple note-ons in quick succession (a 
"machine gun" of note-on events). To finde the location of the peak, we take the derivative of en 
with respect to n and set it to zero:

  den/dn = d/dn [ s*(d0*cd^n - a0*ca^n)  ]
           s * (d0*log(cd)*cd^n - a0*log(ca)*ca^n) = 0

Define: D := d0*log(cd), A := a0*log(ca)

  0 = D*cd^n - A*ca^n -> D*cd^n = A*ca^n
  A / D = cd^n / ca^n
  
Define: R := cd/ca

  A/D = R^n -> n = logR(A/D)
  
that sample instant n the peak location. We now plug that into the equation for en and set that to 1:

  1 = s*(dn-an)
    = s*(d0*cd^n - a0*ca^n)
    = s*((x + ya)*cd^n - (x + yd)*ca^n)
  
  1/s = (x + ya)*cd^n - (x + yd)*ca^n
      =
