In this file, I collect some ideas for how to implement a good sounding oscillator ensemble that may
minimize the ugly phasiness/flanginess that may appear when we just naively spread out the 
frequencies equidistantly and give all oscillators equal amplitude. If applied to a sawtooth 
oscillator and when the number of saws is 7, this is also known as the famous "supersaw" oscillator
popularized by the Roland JP-8000 synthesizer

Frequency Spreading:


Amplitude Scaling:


Filtering:


Frequency Swapping:
-Let the slave oscillators always come in pairs, one above and one below the master osc with a 
 roughly comparable frequency difference, i.e. the outermost ones are paired, the innermost ones 
 too, etc.
-When a slave osc has its phase wraparound, compute a delta/error between the inital phase offset of 
 this slave with respect to the master and its current actual offset. The initial offsett is 
 considered here as a desired, target phase offset that we wish to maintain over time, on average. 
 If the actual offset is too far away from its target value, swap increments (i.e. frequencies) with
 its paired partner osc. The rationale of the frequency swapping between paired partner oscs is that
 we always have one osc playing at each of the desired frequencies, but which osc plays which 
 frequency is changed in accordance to some phase desiderata.
-Maybe instead of measuring the phase offset with respect to the master, we may also measure it with 
 respect to some sort of mean/average phase, averaged over all oscs. I guess, it may lead to some 
 chaotic interaction between the oscs which may be desirable. But computing the mean phase may be 
 expensive, so I'm not sure about that.
-To compute the mean phase, see here:

 especially at 19:16 for a way to compute the intrisic mean:
 -Multiply all factors exp(i*p1) * exp(i*p2) * ... * exp(i*pN)
 -take the N-th root - this gives N possible solutions
 -pick the solution for which the Frechet-function has the lowest value

Misc Ideas:
-Let the slave oscillators not maintain their positions/phases but rather a phase offset with 
 respect to the master osc. This offset should use an increment equal to the difference frequency of
 the slave's and master's frequencies (I think). Normally, we would modulate this offset with 
 another sawtooth wave, but it may be advantageous to try a triangle or trisaw wave instead. The
 rationale behind this is that the offset would undulate around a given initial offset and may avoid
 phase crossings with the master osc (or the other slave oscs). ...not sure about that, though.
-Maybe we should detune the outermost slaves not in terms of an absolute frequency difference but in 
 terms of a musical interval (like +- 50 cents).
-Maybe don't try to avoid phase crossings (i.e. instants at which some oscillators have the same 
 phase) but instead try to make them occurr when the oscs have theri zero crossings.
-Maybe phase-invert some of the saws (which is the same thing as playing them backwards)
