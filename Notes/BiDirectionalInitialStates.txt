Consider a 1st order filter with the difference equation:
  y[n] = a*x[n] + b*y[n-1]
and assume that it has been applied to some input signal in a forward pass. Before applying 
the backward pass, we would conceptually have to keep running the filter for a very long time 
feeding zeros (in practice, until the response tail has decayed away sufficiently), then run 
the filter in the backward direction on the tail to "warm it up" and then, in warmed up state,
run it in backward direction over our actual data. The goal is to replace the tail ring-out 
and warm-up computations with directly setting initial state yNew of the filter for the 
backward pass from its known final state yOld after the forward pass and its coeffs. Let's 
call the last output state of our filter y (== yOld), then the tail of the forward pass is 
given by the expression:
  t[n] = y * b^n
to that tail, we now apply the filter running in reverse direction - the result we call s[n].
We get the difference equation:
  s[n] = a * t[n] + b * s[n+1] = a * y * b^n + b * s[n+1]
the s[n+1] is used for the recursion rather than s[n-1] because we are coming from the right
(future) direction. To get an expression for s[n], we can use wolfram alpha with the input:
  RSolve[s[n] - b*s[n+1] - a*y*b^n == 0, s[n], n]
which gives the result:
  s(n) = c (1/b)^(n - 1) - (a y (b^n - (1/b)^n))/(b^2 - 1) and c element Z
which is the general solution to our recursion equation and depends on a a parameter c which 
we must select according to some boundary condition (it seems, we do not need to take the 
restriction that c should be an integer seriously - it can be a real number - why does wolfram
say it should be integer?). Our boundary condition is that s(inf) == 0. Defining 
  k := 1/b and p := a*y/(b^2 - 1)
we can rewrite s(n) more simply as:
  s(n) = c*k^(n-1) - p*(b^n-k^n)
       = c*k^(n-1) - p*b^n + p*k^n
       = c*k^(n-1) + p*k^n - p*b^n
       = c*k^(n-1) + p*k*k^(n-1) - p*b^n
       = (c + p*k) * k^(n-1) - p*b^n
We have |b| < 1, so |1/b| = |k| > 1, so as n -> inf, p*b^n -> 0, but (c+p*k) * k^(n-1) goes to
infinity unless c+p*k = 0. So, in order to assure s(inf) = 0, we need c+p*k = 0 -> c = -p*k. 
To get our desired filter state, we evaluate s(n) at n=1:
  s(1) = c*k^(1-1) - p*(b^1-k^1) = c - p*(b-k)
So, that's it. In summary, the new filter recursion state yNew which serves as initial state 
before starting the backward pass is computed from the current recursion state yOld after the 
forward pass and the filter coeffs a,b as:
  k = 1/b; p = a*yOld/(b*b-1); c = -p*k; s(1) = yNew = c - p*(b-k);
This can be further simplifed into:
  yNew = a*yOld*b / (1-b*b)
using 1 div, 3 mul, 1 sub. Maybe make some experiments, which formula is numerically more 
accurate - maybe it's not the most efficient/simplified one? Maybe try to avoid dividing by
1-b^2 because that denominator becomes inaccurate as |b| gets close to 1 (which is typical).
We can transform it to (using y := yOld):
  yNew = a*y*b / (1-b*b) = a*y*b / (b*(1/b - b)) = ...


Why do we have to compute c manually from the boundary condition? Why does this code:
  RSolve[{s[n] - b*s[n+1] - a*y*b^n == 0, s[Infinity] == 0}, s[n], n] 
not work? A working example for solving a recursion with boundary condition is:
 RSolve[{a[n + 1] - 2 a[n] == 1, a[0] == 1}, a[n], n]

Note that when using the explicit formula to compute the tail s(n), it works well only when b 
is an (inverse) power of two because otherwise the numerical errors in the computations of c 
and p seem to mess up everything.

Now let's consider the slightly more complicated case of a one-pole/one-zero filter with the
difference equation:
  y[n] = a*x[n] + b*y[n-1] + d*x[n-1]
(we don't use c, because wolfram wants to use c for the free parameter in the solution - we want
to avoid confusion). Let's call the final input and output sample x1 and y1 respectively, so:
  x1 := x[N-1], y1 := y[N-1] 
where N is the length of the input signal. Let's call the tail signal resulting from the forward
pass again t[n] - we have:
  t[0] = y1
  t[1] = b*t[0] + d*x1 =      b*y1 + d*x1
  t[2] = b*t[1] + d*0  =   b*(b*y1 + d*x1)
  t[3] = b*t[2] + d*0  = b*b*(b*y1 + d*x1)
  t[n] = b^(n-1) * (b*y1 + d*x1)   for all n >= 1
defining
  q := b*y1 + d*x1
we can write this as:
  t[n] = b^(n-1) * q   for all n >= 1
The tail s[n] after both passes (forward/backward) satisfies the recurrence relation:
  s[n] = a*t[n] + b*s[n+1] + d*t[n+1]
       = a*q*b^(n-1) + b*s[n+1] + d*q*b^n
which we solve with wolfram alpha:
  RSolve[s[n] == a*q*b^(n-1) + b*s[n+1] + d*q*b^n , s[n], n]
which gives the result:
  s(n) = c (1/b)^(n - 1) - (q (b^n - (1/b)^n) (a + b d))/(b (b^2 - 1)) and c element Z
Defining:
  k := 1/b, p := q*(a+b*d) / (b*(b^2-1))
We can write this as:
  s(n) = c*k^(n-1) - p*(b^n-k^n)
       = (c+p*k) * k^(n-1) - p*b^n
which is the same formula as before in the one-pole/no-zero filter case. Our boundary condition is
again s(inf) = 0, so we again get our constant c as:
  c = -p*k
In summary, to set our state new variables in the filter, we may use: 
  q = b*y1 + d*x1
  p = q*(a+b*d) / (b*(b^2-1))
  k = 1/b
  c = -p*k
  x[n-1] = t[1] = q
  y[n-1] = s[1] = c - p*(b-k)
But this can be further simplified, for example by sage via:
  var("x y a b c d q p k y1")
  #q = b*y + d*x  # better not define q in terms of other - we need it for x1
  p = q*(a+b*d) / (b*(b^2-1))
  k = 1/b
  c = -p*k
  y1 = c - p*(b-k)
  y1.simplify_full()
which results in:
  -(b*d + a)*q/(b^2 - 1)
eventually, given the x1,y1 values after the forward pass, we can compute the new, updated x1,y1
states needed to run the backward pass via:
  x1 = b*y1 + d*x1               // update x1
  y1 = (b*d + a)*x1 / (1 - b^2)  // updating y1 uses the updated x1

Now let's consider a biquad filter with the difference equation:
