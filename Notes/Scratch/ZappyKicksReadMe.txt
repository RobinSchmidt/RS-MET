A pack of samples that can be used as electronic bassdrums or, depending on the parameters, for 
"zap" sounds. The samples are all based on impulse responses of a specifically tuned chain of 
allpass filters. This means, the initial raw material has a *perfectly* white spectrum because the 
impulse itself is perfectly white and an allpass has a white magnitude spectrum by definition. The 
idea for this was inpired by a statement of Ady Scorb in this video at 9:57:

  "The philosophy I've come up with is: a kickdrum is like an impulse smeared in time. You want to 
  represent all the frequencies smoothly all the way down. This has the benefit of exciting every 
  frequency in a space and therefore you'll gonna get less nulls, less peaks and better translation 
  and better power in more spaces."

The technique of feeding an impulse into an allpass filter achieves exactly that - smearing an 
impulse in time - in a mathematically perfect way. A bit of post-processing has been applied, 
though: the initially white output of the allpass chain has been filtered by a first order lowpass 
to give the spectrum a -6 dB/oct slope. Then, some subsonic mud has been removed by DC blocker 
highpass. Then a smooth fade-out was applied. 

Although the samples can be used as is, they are mainly meant to be used as raw material for 
further shaping. Out of the box, the samples as such are completely atonal. If you like tuned 
bassdrums, you may want to process them further by perhaps boosting some frequency around your 
fundamental with a peaking filter or maybe a resonant highpass.
