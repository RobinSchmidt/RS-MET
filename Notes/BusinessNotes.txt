Pricing:  

-40 €/h for work in my codebase (algorithm research and development, feature implementation,
 optimization, etc.)
 
-80 €/h for work in the client's codebase (assisting with integration into the client's system,  
 testing and debugging, etc.)
 
-Milestone-based charging. Work for one week is scheduled and an appropriate milestone is defined, 
 then I'll do the work and when the milestone is reached I charge the 1600€ = 40 h * 40 €/h. If
 necessary, the granularity can be reduced within reason - say down to days - but no 
 micro-accounting anymore (like keeping a tab of worktimes to 5 min precision as I previuosly did). 
 That's really a drag on productivity.
 
-Licensing for existing DSP code (RAPT/rosic): 1500 € for 1 product, 2500 for 2, 3500 for 3, 
 4500 for 4, 5000 for 5, 7500 for 10.
 
-These license prices go down when also work hours are purchased. If two weeks of work (= 3200€) 
 are purchased, the single product license cost goes down to 1000 -> just divide everything by 1.5.
 When 4 weeks of work are purchased (6400€), the license prices go down by a factor of 2 
 (750, 1250, 1750, 2250, 2500) and when 8 weeks of work are purchased, they go down by a factor of 
 3. In general, they go down by log2(numWeeks). 
 
-The license is valid for the version of the code at the time of purchase. License updates for 
 newer versions of the code are 1/10 of the original license price - without the for-work discounts
 but with the for-quantity discounts. If multiple licenses were bought one at a time (i.e. at the 
 higher per license prices), the update cost will nevertheless get the quantity discount for 
 whatever number of licenses were purchased.
