As of version 6.x, JUCE uses CMake as build system. The Projucer is still there and seems to still
work, but somewhere, the doc says, that for plugin projects, one now needs to use CMake. See:

https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/docs/CMake%20API.md
https://forum.juce.com/t/native-built-in-cmake-support-in-juce/38700
https://forum.juce.com/t/learning-cmake-done-right-with-juce-6/40582/2

Here is a project that contains a .jucer to cmake converter:

Surge can also be built for LV2:

For the next update: 
-Retain the folder structure of the original juce repo (last time, i moved some folders into 
 different places)
-Use the fork that allows to build LV2 plugins

older:

-classes like SliderListener have been replaced with Slider::Listener
-the subcomoponents may now be direct members instead of pointers, so we don't
 need to call deleteAllChildren in the destructor of components 
 
 this fork of juce is supposed to have LV2 support:

 at leats, this thread says so:
