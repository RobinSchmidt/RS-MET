Directory structure:
-Libraries:
 -JUCE   Jules' Utility Class Extensions
 -RAPT   Rob's Audio Processig Toolkit
 -JURA   JUCE/RAPT Software Framework
-Products:
 -AudioPlugin (one project for all plugins)
  -ChaosGenerator
 
Build System:
-JURA is built as DLL and itself compiles all the required JUCE and RAPT code into it

-the ChaosGenerator uses the JURA.dll
 -> binary code 

 
Building RAPT:
-RAPT is not supposed to be built by itself, but is directly compiled into the 
 client code.
-The client code should include the RAPT.h file somewhere and add the RAPT.cpp 
 file to their project, in order to compile the library along with the client
 code.
-Many functions and classes are templated and the RAPT.cpp file is responsible
 for instantiating the templates for specific data types.
-Client code may create further instantiations for additional datatypes

and the client code is responsible

...I'll probably need to update JUCE first - it's about time anyway
