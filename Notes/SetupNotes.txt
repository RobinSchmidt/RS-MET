to make debugging work in CodeBlock on windows, one has to go to:

  Setting -> Debugger
  
go on the "Default" tree item and set the path to the debugger, in my case:

  C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin\gdb32.exe
  
for debugging 32 bit builds. Debugger type is set to GDB. It's also important to 
uncheck the "Disable startup scripts (-nx) (GDB only)" checkbox in order to be able
to see the contents of a std::vector
